**Type Three with a Healthy Connection to Type Six:** When Threes integrate the positive  
aspects of type Six they let go of their identification with their performance and start to focus  
more on working cooperatively with others toward shared goals, ideals and aspirations, like  
healthy Sixes. Rather than having to be the star who dazzles everybody, they are able to support  
a project or cause that serves a higher purpose for its own sake rather than for the recognition  
they might receive. No longer run by their fears of failure, integrating Threes become less  
competitive with others. They value close, committed affiliations with family and friends more.  
They are able to be more authentically self-revealing. Average Threes feel as if they have to  
make it on their own in life and so they work extremely hard to defeat the competition and stand  
out as a winner. Integrating Threes, however, have the courage and self-esteem to ask for help  
and support when they need it. This does not come easily for a type that feels intense pressure  
to have their act together all the time and accomplish their goals with little or no help from  
anyone. As Threes let their guard down and learn to trust others, they are able to build lasting  
bonds with people based on mutual respect. They are pleasantly surprised to learn that others  
actually enjoy helping them achieve success precisely because they value what’s best for the  
group more than being an unblemished soloist. They let go of their need to outshine others and  
become more selfless and courageous. With support from their own inner guidance and from  
others they become more compassionate and self-sacrificial, like healthy Sixes.  
**Type Three with a Healthy Connection to Type Nine:** When Threes integrate the positive  
aspects of type Nine they slow down, open their heart and become more receptive to life. They  
become more patient, peaceful and learn to appreciate the process of their life as much as their  
achievements. They become more inclusive of others and become more interested in supporting  
others rather than competing against them. They see life from a broader perspective and develop  
more of a live-and-let-live philosophy. They become more humble yet maintain their selfassuredness.  
They are able to trust more and get things done from the still, calm center within  
rather than frantically feeling they have to do everything themselves.  
**Type Three with an Unhealthy Connection to Type Six:** When Threes deteriorate to the  
negative aspects of type Six they can experience feelings of self-doubt and anxiety. They become  
more nervous and fearful of disapproval from others. They may overcommit themselves, become  
more dependent on the positive affirmation of others and fear being rejected. They can try to  
find their identity and security in affiliations with others rather than following their true heart’s  
desires. They may have trouble making decisions for themselves and look for corroboration from  
trusted allies. They also become more suspicious of others’ motives and get defensive more  
easily.

**Type Three with an Unhealthy Connection to Type Nine:** When Threes deteriorate to the  
negative aspects of type Nine it is usually because they have been driving themselves too hard  
and are having trouble coping with the incredible stress they are under. They may be burnedout.  
They can spend more time zoning out in front of the TV or going on autopilot in other ways.  
They can lose their ambitious focus, become depressed and slow down. They can become more  
habitual in their routines, trying to stay busy but becoming more ineffective with their time. If, in  
their quest for success, they choose work that isn’t based on their true heart’s desires they can  
eventually become disillusioned, disengaged and dissociated from life, like unhealthy Nines. They  
can lose interest in their projects and appear indifferent, listless and apathetic. Feelings of  
emptiness can arise. They may withdraw from people and stubbornly resist help from anyone  
who can see a problem developing. They may avoid their problems, hoping they will go away on  
their own. They can spend more time daydreaming about how they are going to make it big with  
their next success.
