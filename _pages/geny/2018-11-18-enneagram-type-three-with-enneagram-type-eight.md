**<u>Enneagram Type Three with Enneagram Type Eight</u>**

** **

# <u>Why the Attraction?</u>

  * This is not a common When it occurs, Threes are initially attracted to Eights because they are self- confident, self-assertive, competent, successful and powerful. Threes can seem very self-confident on the surface but in truth they’re not (average to unhealthy Threes at least), otherwise they wouldn’t need to promote themselves or boast about their accomplishments. Threes feel more confident because of Eight’s strength and fearlessness. Like Threes, Eights go after what they want in life with single-minded determination and enormous energy. Threes and Eights admire that in each other. Eights don’t care as muchas Threes about what other people think of them. Threes find that attractive. Eights can be very generous,tender-hearted and attentive when in love (the Heart Point for Eight is type Two) and Threes thrive on that kind of positive attention. Threes also have a very generous, caring side (Threes have a Two wing) and, when they feel appreciated and safe, enjoy reciprocating the Eight’s love.
  * Eights are initially attracted to Three’s charisma, apparent self-confidence, drive, ambition, leadership qualities, public relations skills and Both Threes and Eights are work-oriented but Eights are not as diplomatic or as good team players as Threes. Threes help Eights become more tactful and work better with people. Eights admire Three’s flexibility/adaptability, so different from their own unyielding, all-or-nothing, excessive behavior. Threes and Eights can get along well because both champion, motivate and support each other.

# <u>Potential Problems</u>

  * Trust and control can become major issues in this Eights can be jealous and possessive. To feel safe in the relationship, Eight tests the Three’s strength, loyalty, honesty, trustworthiness, etc. The Eight wants to know the Three’s character before s/he is willing to be vulnerable, let his/her guard down and be open to love whole-heartedly. Eights are tender inside and fear having their heart trampled on (like happened in childhood?). Three’s don’t like the Eights control tactics and don’t like confrontations either. Threes deal with this by being evasive (throwing themselves more into their work), dishonest (out of fear of the Eight) or covertly controlling themselves. Any of these responses to the Eight’s control tactics just serves to arouse Eight’s suspicions and mistrust of the Three. Once Eight begins to doubt the Three’s trustworthiness the relationship starts going downhill. At this point Eight can become very controlling and ever more wary of the Three’s potential disloyalty. The Eight can withdraw attention, affection and support of the Three which makes the Three feel unappreciated. Three can also feel belittled and demeaned by the Eight’s bossiness,criticality and domineering ways. Neither Threes nor Eights are good at asking for what they need and both can become manipulative to get what they want. This doesn’t work and both become more suspicious of each other’s motives. Threes can see Eights as vengeful tyrants and Eights can see Threes as untrustworthy liars.An ugly, nasty breakup can be the result.
