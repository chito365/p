OSI Model and Security Security Services Authentication Access control Data confidentiality Data integrity Nonrepudiation Logging and monitoring Security Mechanisms EnciphermentDigital signature Access control Data integrity Authentication Traffic padding Routing protocol Notarization Basic Network Security Infrastructures Router A network traffic management device that, unbeknownst to the user, sits between subnetworks(LANs) and routes traffic intended for or leaving the network segments to which it’s attached Packet Filter A simple and effective form of protection that matches all packets against a series of rules Basic Packet Filtering Allows communication originating from one side of the communication path or the other Identifies and controls traffic by examining the source, destination, port number, and protocol types StatefulInspection Packet Filtering A more complex packet-filtering technology that keeps track of the state of the current connection to help assure that only desired traffic passes through Benefits of Packet-Filtering Routers Little or no cost to implement because packet filtering is a feature of standard routers Little impact on router performance Generally transparent to users and applications Limitations of Packet-Filtering Routers Defining packet filters can be a complex task The filtering rule set can become complicated, increasing in difficulty to manage and comprehend There are few testing facilities to verify the correctness of the filtering rules The packet throughput of a router decreases as the number of filters increase It is not capable of understanding the context/data of a particular service Firewalls Firewalls typically run monitoring software to detect and thwart external attacks on the site and protect the internal corporate network Firewalls are an essential device for network security Many of the architectures needed for security rely on one or more firewalls within an intelligent design Application-Level Gateway Firewall Allows the network administrator to implement stricter security policies than packet-filtering routers can manage Requires special-purpose code (a proxy service) for each desired application The proxy code can be configured to support only acceptable features of an application Users are permitted access to the proxy services, but may not log in to the application-level gateway itself Bastion Hosts An application-level gateway is often referred to as a bastion host because it is a designated system that is specifically armored and protected against attacks Application-level gateways allow information to flow between systems but do not allow the direct exchange of data Benefits of Application-Level Gateways The network manager has complete control over each service and permitted services It has the ability to support strong user authentication and provide detailed logging information The filtering rules are much easier to configure and test Limitations of Application-Level Gateways It requires either that users modify their behavior or that specialized software be installed on each system that accesses proxy services Firewall Implementation Examples Packet-Filter Router Inexpensive and transparent to users Inherent limitations of a packet-filtering router Screened Host Firewalls Public information server can be placed on the segment shared by the packet-filtering router and the bastion host DMZ or Screened-Subnet Firewall Private network is invisible Inside users must access the Internet via the proxy services Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) IDSs attempt to detect an intruder breaking into systems or an authorized user misusing system resources IDSs are needed to detect both types of intrusions Break-in attempts from the outside Knowledgeable insider attacks Two basic philosophical options Prohibit everything that is not expressly permitted Permit everything that is not expressly denied A Good Intrusion Detection System must run continually without human supervision be fault tolerant resist subversion impose minimal overhead on the attached network observe deviations from normal behavior be easily tailored to the network cope with changing system behavior False Positives, False Negatives, and Subversion Attacks A false positive occurs when the system classifies an action as anomalous when it is legitimate A false negative occurs when an intrusive action has occurred but the system allows it to pass as nonintrusive behavior A subversion error occurs when an intruder modifies the operation of the intrusion detector to force false negatives to occur Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) VPN is a network technology that makes it possible to establish private “tunnels” over the public Internet IP security (IPSec) operates at both the Network Layer and Session Layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack IPSecVPNs are the most common form in use today and are widely available from network and firewall providers IPsec &#8211; Performs both encryption and authentication to address the inherent lack of security on IP-based networks Three characteristics &#8211; Sender authentication, message integrity, and data confidentiality Security Association (SA) AH and ESP require a number of parameters that both senders and receivers must agree on An SA is used to manage these parameters An SA is a secure “connection” between two end-points that applies a security policy and keys to protect information An SA is uniquely identified by the combination of three fields: IP destination address, security protocol identifier (AH or ESP), and security parameter index (SPI) IPSecKey Management Manual key exchange (IETF RFC 1825): Using the manual exchange, a person manually configures each system with its own keys and those needed to communicate with other VPNs Simple Key Interchange Protocol (SKIP): SKIP is based on the generation of a shared secret using Diffie-Hellman with already authenticated public key values Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)/Oakley: ISAKMP is needed to negotiate, establish, modify, and delete security associations and their corresponding data SECURING MULTI-PLATFORM SYSTEMS Networks are increasingly heterogeneous, containing different types of hardware and software and running multiple operating systems that all need to be able tocommunicate with one another. There are fewer and fewer pure Windows (or pure UNIX) shops, with many companies running Windows domains side-by-side with UNIX web servers, accessed by client computers running Windows, Linux and Mac. Add to the mix a variety of smart phones (Windows Mobile, iPhone, Android, Symbian and more) that need to download mail and possibly access other network resources, and you have a real challenge. The same basic security concepts apply to both heterogeneous and homogeneous networks, so it goes without saying that, regardless of the platform(s), you should: Secure the edge with a good firewall/threat management gateway and intrusion detection/prevention system Use anti-virus and anti-malware software (including on non-Windows systems) and keep definitions updated Implement security auditing/monitoring to detect attempted breaches Harden systems by turning off unnecessary services Close unused ports Restrict physical access to the systems Restrict administrative/root access to those who really need it; on UNIX systems, restrict root access to secure terminals Implement file level permissions; on UNIX systems, partition the file system and use read-only partitions for storing files that don’t change often, and use ACLs (Access Control Lists) for complex permissions management On UNIX systems, limit the access processes have on the file system by using the chrootand ulimitinterfaces Enforce strong password policies In high security environments, require two-factor authentication On UNIX systems, use SSH (Secure Shell) for remote command line access Use encryption: to protect files on the drive, to protect data crossing the network, to protect the operating system from unauthorized access Implement a public key infrastructure to issue digital certificates Hire an outside security auditor A third party security audit can be useful to evaluate and advise on the security implementation in any complex network, but that goes double for a heterogeneous network. A company that does security audits for a living will have personnel experienced in reviewing many different types of systems and will be current on new vulnerabilities and new solutions that your IT personnel may not have the time to keep up with. They can perform penetration testing for a real-world assessment of where the vulnerabilities lie, and they can advise you on the most effective and most cost-effective ways to close the gaps. Summary The Telecommunications, Network, and Internet Security domain is one of the most important areas that security practitioners must understand well We can begin to mix and match the building blocks of network security tools and techniques to implement defense in depth in preserving confidentiality, integrity, and availability It is important to know how to find security information and how to decide which security architecture is most appropriate for a given situation
