Software process: organizing a structured set of activities to develop software systems.  
Many different software processes but all involve the following activities:  
Specification – defining what the system should do;  
Design and implementation – defining the organization of the system and implementing the system;  
Validation – checking that it does what the customer wants;  
Evolution – changing the system in response to changing customer needs.
