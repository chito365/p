_Each_ _and_ _every_ _component_ _that_ _makes_ _up_ _your_ _life experience is drawn to you by the powerful <u>Law</u>  <u>of Attraction</u>’s response to the thoughts you think and the story you tell about your life. Your money and financial assets; your body’s state of wellness, clarity, flexibility, size, and shape; your work environment, how you are treated, work satisfaction, and rewards—indeed, the very happiness of your life experience in general— is all happening because of the story that you tell. If you will let your dominant intention be to revise and improve the content of the story you tell every day of your life, it is our absolute promise to you that your life will become that ever-improving story. For by the powerful <u>Law of Attraction, </u>it must be!_

&nbsp;

You have wanted more success and you have applied yourself well, doing everything that everyone said you should do, but the success you have been seeking has been slow to come. You tried very hard, especially at first, to learn all the right things, to be in the right places, to do the right things, to say the right things . . . but often things did not appear to be improving much at all.

Earlier in your life, when you were first dipping your toe into the idea of achieving success, you found satisfaction in satisfying the expectations of the others who were laying out the rules for success. The teachers, parents, and mentors who surrounded you seemed confident and convincing as they laid out their rules for success:

&nbsp;

“Always be on time; always do your best; remember to work hard; always be honest; strive for greatness; go the extra mile; there’s no gain without pain; and, most important, never give up. . . .” But, over time, your finding satisfaction from gaining the approval of those who laid out those rules waned  as  their  principles  of  success—no  matter  how  hard  you  tried—did  not  yield  you  the promised results. And it was more disheartening still when you stood back to gain some perspective on the whole picture and realized that their principles were not, for the most part, bringing _them_ real success either. And then, to make matters even worse, you began meeting others (who clearly were _not_ following those rules) who _were_ achieving success apart from the formula that you had been so diligent to learn and apply.

And so you found yourself asking: “What’s going on here? How can those who are working so hard be receiving so little, while those who seem to be working so little are achieving so much? My expensive education hasn’t paid off at all—and yet that multimillionaire dropped out of high school. My father worked hard every day of his life—and yet our family had to borrow the money to pay for his funeral. . . . Why doesn’t my hard work pay off for me the way it was supposed to? Why do so few really get rich, while most of us struggle to barely get by? What am I missing? What do those fnancially successful people know that I don’t know?”
