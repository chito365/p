<span style="font-family:Verdana;"><strong>1.</strong> First, set up a pushbutton switch to deliver a logic level input. View its output on a scope, and look at the switch bounce. Measure the duration of the switch bounce.</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Then, set up a 555 timer that outputs a square wave with a period of 1.5 times the duration of the bounce for your switch. Finally, use that timer to drive a D-flop that debounces your switch. Use one of the flops on a 74HCT74N chip. View the debounced output on your scope next to the input. How much time delay is there between the input and output signals?</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Make sure to tie S and R inputs HIGH (inactive).</span></p> 

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Now, get ahold of a 74HCT273N D-register. Use the output of your debounced switch to clock the register. Attach 8 logic-level input switches to the D inputs of your register. Attach LED&#8217;s, or a 7 segment LED to the Q outputs of your register. Remember to tie the R reset HIGH (inactive).</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Experiment with your new circuit by pressing down different input buttons and then clocking your register with the debounced switch.</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Then, add a logic level input switch to the R reset input. This input should be normally HIGH, but should output LOW when the switch is pressed. Experiment with this Reset button. Which takes priority for the chip, the clock pulse or the reset pulse?<br /></span>
