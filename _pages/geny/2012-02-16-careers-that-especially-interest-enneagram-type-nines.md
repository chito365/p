# Careers That Especially Interest Nines

Enneagram Nines can be found in many different occupations but there are certain occupations  
that they are drawn to because of their natural gifts, talents and values. Here is a list of some of  
them.  
**Healthy Nines are patient, understanding, compassionate and insightful. They are also**  
**positive, supportive, accepting and reassuring. With these innate characteristics many**
