**9 Words Women Use (and Men Need to Know)**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**1) Fine** This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up. ** **

**2) Five Minutes** If she is getting dressed, this means a half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given five more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house. ** **

**3) Nothing** This is the calm before the storm. This means something, and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with nothing usually end in fine.

**4) Go Ahead** This is a dare, not permission. Don’t Do It! ** **

**5) Loud Sigh** This is actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A loud sigh means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you about nothing. (Refer back to # 3 for the meaning of nothing.)

**6) That’s Okay** This is one of the most dangerous statements a women can make to a man. That’s okay means she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.

**7) Thanks** A woman is thanking you, do not question, or faint. Just say you’re welcome. (I want to add in a clause here – This is true, unless she says ‘Thanks a lot’ – that is PURE sarcasm and she is not thanking you at all. DO NOT say ‘you’re welcome’ . that will bring on a ‘whatever’).

**8 ) Whatever** Is a woman’s way of saying F– YOU!

**9) Don’t worry about it, I got it** Another dangerous statement, meaning this is something that a woman has told a man to do several times, but is now doing it herself. This will later result in a man asking ‘What’s wrong?’ For the woman’s response refer to #3. &#8220;Nothing&#8221;
