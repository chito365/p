**Type One with a Healthy Connection to Type Seven:** When Ones integrate the positive  
aspects of type Seven their judgments of others and self-criticism begin to relax. They allow  
pleasure, spontaneity and fun back into their lives in a more balanced way. They shift their  
attention away from what’s not working in a situation to what is working. They make decisions  
more easily because they recognize what they want rather than fretting over what they “must” or  
“should” do. They become less inhibited and guilt-ridden and are able to express the full range of  
their emotions. Their funny, witty and relaxed side can finally come out and they often enjoy  
telling jokes and stories. They plan more activities for sheer pleasure and lead more adventurous  
lives. They are better able to see different points of view rather than thinking their way is the  
right or best way. As they integrate their soul child their minds open to many new possibilities  
and they have greater access to their curiosity, imagination, optimism and creative intelligence.  
Rather than feeling resentful and obligated, they will feel lighter, freer, more enthusiastic,  
accepting and grateful, like healthy Sevens. As they wake up to the way things really are they’ll  
feel much closer to their fellow human beings and wonder how they ever got caught in the trap of  
focusing on what was wrong with them, others and the world in the first place. Ultimately, they  
will see the inherent perfection in everything and everyone and come to marvel and delight in life.

**Type One with a Healthy Connection to Type Four:** When Ones integrate the positive  
aspects of type Four they get in touch with buried emotional needs and deeper authentic feelings  
by allowing themselves to turn inward. By allowing some painful and sad childhood memories to  
surface, they become more self-aware, healed and better able to articulate what they want to do  
rather than what they should do. They find more meaning in their life by establishing sincere,  
warm, empathic connections with people. They become more creative, intuitive and develop a  
more refined, subtle sense of humor. By letting go of control and letting everything be as it  
already is, Ones at point Four can finally get in touch with their true heart’s desire rather than  
their ego’s desire. If they can relax their self-condemnation, the Essence of their being will guide  
them where they want to go.  
**Type One with an Unhealthy Connection to Type Seven:** When Ones deteriorate to the  
negative aspects of type Seven they may become more self-indulgent and pleasure seeking.  
They are angry about years of self-deprivation and now want to let loose. Gluttony, the passion  
of type Seven, gets acted out through a sense of entitlement. They could become impulsive,  
selfish, greedy, irresponsible, outspoken or even “naughty” if they feel they can get away with it  
– like a little child. In light of this understanding, it is not as surprising then to hear about the  
pious priest who gets caught with his pants down at a motel with a prostitute or the evangelical  
Christian who has been “playing” with a choir boy for years! At their worst they could become  
self-destructive through alcohol, substance abuse or some other form of excessive behavior.

**Type One with an Unhealthy Connection to Type Four:** When Ones deteriorate to the  
negative aspects of type Four it is usually because they are confronted with the fearful recognition  
that their beliefs, opinions and views about people and life may actually be wrong or at least  
flawed because they aren’t working or making them happy. They may also fear ever being able  
to live up to their ideal self. At this point their anxiety and stress can start to exceed their coping  
strategies. They can become more self-absorbed and turn their anger inward, becoming  
depressed. They can feel as though life is hopeless and meaningless as they become more  
disenchanted, disillusioned and disappointed with themselves and others. They can withdraw into  
romantic fantasies and long for what they don’t have and yet doubt ever being able to get it.  
They can have a profound sense of dissatisfaction with people and reality the way it is. They  
yearn to live in a more perfect, ideal world and yet feel helpless to do anything about it. They  
become envious, comparing themselves to happy, successful people OR completely self-loathing  
because they aren’t at all like their ideal self. Their idealistic expectations of others and life are  
not being met either. They can become emotional, moody, socially withdrawn, painfully selfconscious,  
self-indulgent, hostile and stormy. At worst, they can turn their own high standards  
against themselves and punish themselves for their fatally flawed self and/or “bad” behavior.
