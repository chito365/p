## Quotes:

> Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton&#8217;s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen &#8211; while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.

### The 45th President of the United States  
Donald J. Trump

_&#8220;We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will Make America Great Again!&#8221;_

_&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8211; President&nbsp;Donald J. Trump_

Donald J. Trump is the very definition of the American success story, setting the standards of excellence in his business endeavors, and now, for the United States of America.

A graduate of the Wharton School of Finance, President Trump has always dreamed big and pushed the boundaries of what is possible his entire career, devoting his life to building business, jobs and the American Dream. This was brought to life by a movement he inspired in the people of America when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States in June 2015.

This movement would ultimately lead to one of the most unique Presidential campaigns in history.&nbsp; Ever the leader, Trump followed no rule book and took his message, “Make America Great Again” directly to the people.&nbsp; Campaigning in historically democratic states and counties across the country, Trump was elected President in November 2016 in the largest electoral college landslide for a Republican in 28 years.

President Trump is working hard to implement his ‘America First’ platform, continuing his promise to the American people to lower taxes, repeal and replace Obamacare, end stifling regulations, protect our borders, keep jobs in our country, take care of our veterans, strengthen our military and law enforcement, and renegotiate bad trade deals, creating a government of, by and for the people.
