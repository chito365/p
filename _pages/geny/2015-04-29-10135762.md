Quantitative Variable &#8211; A quantitative variable is naturally measured as a number for which meaningful arithmetic operations make sense. Examples: Height, age, crop yield, GPA, salary, temperature, area, air pollution index (measured in parts per million), etc. Categorical Variable &#8211; Any variable that is not quantitative is categorical. Categorical variables take a value that is one of several possible categories.

Dependent and Independent Variables- An independent variable, sometimes called anexperimentalorpredictorvariable, is a variable that is being manipulated in an experiment in order to observe the effect on adependentvariable, sometimes called anoutcomevariable.

Continuous or Quantitative Variables

Discrete and qualitative.
