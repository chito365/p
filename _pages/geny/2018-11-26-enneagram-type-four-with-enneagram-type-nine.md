# <u>Potential Problems</u>

  * Fours and Nines don’t like However, Fours tend to focus on what’s missing in their relationship and when that happens they can start to be more demanding and critical of the Nine. Nines give unconditional acceptance to their partner and want it in return. Fours are looking for excitement and intensity in a relationship. Nines are looking for comfort. Therein lies the rub. As the relationship gets comfortable over time Fours will miss the emotional “juice” of the romance stage that made them feel alive. As Four gets more demanding and critical Nine gets more disengaged, emotionally lifeless, uncommunicative and unresponsive

– the very opposite of what Four wants! Fours can become even more demanding and dramatic as they hate being ignored. It can also ignite Fours fear of abandonment and rejection. Fours can be very nasty when their sensitive feelings get hurt. They will start blaming and accusing the Nine of being neglectful.

  * Nines can see Fours as too: demanding, critical, moody, self-absorbed, dramatic, unpredictable, emotionally volatile and Nines get angered by Four’s demands for more intensity and initiative. They also don’t like being devalued and vehemently rejected when they haven’t changed.
  * Fours can see Nines as too: neglectful of their own priorities and of the Four, comfort seeking, impossible to get through to, stubborn, irresponsible and lazy, lacking in intensity and vitality, boring and hopelessly
