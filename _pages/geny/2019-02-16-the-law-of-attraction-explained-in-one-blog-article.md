## What is The Law of Attraction?

<p class="has-drop-cap">
  The Law of Attraction is a simple universal principle that uses the power of focus to bring whatever is in our being into our reality. Basically, like attracts like. If you focus on the negative things in your life, you will bring more negativity into your life. While if you focus on the positive side of life and the goals you want to achieve, you will find more ways to be happy and more opportunities to achieve your goals will appear.<br />Regardless of one’s age, nationality or religious belief, the Law of Attraction is often one of life’s pleasant mysteries. Even so, it has been a common understanding through the centuries that what you give out to the world, will return to your life in some way shape or form.
</p>

Whether or not we know it, we are using the Law of Attraction every second that we exist. Your thoughts and feelings affect everything around you. This is why just a simple shift in your perspective can make a big change and attract better things in your life because you will receive what you put out. If you get in tune with the law of attraction, you can start using it to make your life exactly what you want it to be.

## Is the Law of Attraction Real?

<p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size: 1px;">
  Quantum physics has helped to show the power of the mind, emotions, and observant participation, and the effects these have on our lives, environment, and the universe. The more scientists explore this, the more we understand how significant the mind, gut, and heart is, and how together they can shape the world around us. As physicists give us more information about our power in the world, the more we can enjoy it and realize that we are the co-creators and primary influencers of our lives.
</p>

The law of attraction is very similar to the law of gravity. We can understand what gravity does but we don’t fully understand why. Most of the laws in the universe work like this without us fully understanding them, but they are there nonetheless.

In psychology, there is a perspective called ‘Internal vs. External Locus of Control.” Internal Locus of Control is when the person believes that he or she can influence events and their outcomes. External Locus of Control is when the person blames outside forces for everything. The Law of Attraction goes by a similar set of principles as found in the internal locus of control.

It still might seem like magic and that something like this is impossible, if at least improbable. It is hard to really prove something when it has to do with thoughts and feelings. It is a bit different than gravity because when you throw something into the air, it will fall back down. You don’t need to understand it because it just happens.

Even so, technology and science are finally advanced enough to allow us to see the effects of our thoughts. There is now scientific evidence to prove that our thoughts do have effects on us and the environment around us.

The 1993 D.C meditation experiment is an example of just that. A group of 4,000 meditators volunteered to meditate on peace and love with the intention to reduce crime. The scientists tested for every variable and were unbiased. The results showed during the month the meditation occurred, crime dropped 25%, proving the power of positive thoughts, feelings, and visualizations.

In 1979, 70 to 80-year-old men were in a study to see the difference between remembering being young and pretending to be young. One group reminisced about their younger days while the other group pretended to be young. The results of this experiment showed that the ones who pretended to be young actually showed signs of de-aging like lowered blood pressure, diminished arthritis, and marked improvements in eyesight and hearing.

Another famous experiment was conducted by Dr. Masaru Emoto who watched how water crystals froze after love, peace, hate, and fear, among others, were spoken and projected through thoughts and intentions or written on the glass containing the sample. The results were all the same. The ones with positive intentions frozen in beautiful symmetrical crystals while the ones with negative intentions resulted in disjointed, broken crystals. This proved that our intentions can physically affect the world around us. Although this particular experiment has never been replicated, it poses an interesting question about our relationship to the world within and around us.

The placebo effect is another way we can see how thoughts and belief can impact our reality. This is where you believe the medicine you are taking is real and will have actual effects and heal you, and it does. It proves how strong the power of belief can be and if you know something will happen, it will.

## How to use the Law of Attraction?

The Law of Attraction is only limited by your imagination so make sure you take time to think about what you want that will best fit where you are in your life and where you want it to be. The biggest thing about the law of attraction is that you have to believe that it will work. If you are having doubts, try it out with small things like finding $5 or making a new friend until you notice the effects. Once the result happens, it will make you a believer for sure and you can move onto something bigger. For some powerful guidance look into the work of Abraham Hicks and begin the process of applying the various principles she offers.

## The 4 Step Process of The Law of Attraction.

**Step 1** – Start with a decision. This is the most important step because it prepares you to receive and aligns you with your desires. You need to make a clear decision of what you really want, it doesn’t matter how big or small it is, you just have to believe it’s possible.

When you decide what you want, you need to start to imagine it with all of your sense as if it has already happened. Spending time in meditation, imagining your life with what you want to attract can help a lot. How do you feel once this new thing is in your life? Make it as real as possible in your mind. Focus on receiving it, how it will be in your life, and what it looks like to have already lived through the experience your looking to accomplish.

**Step 2** – Practice Unconditional Love. Basically, if you don’t feel like you deserve what you are asking for, you won’t get it. You might have subconscious fears and doubts that will get in the way of receiving what you want. It can be really difficult to rid yourself of the doubt.

This step will help you bring awareness to the thoughts and feelings that you have. The only way to get rid of the doubt is to be aware of them and approach them with love and positivity. You are experiencing the doubt and fear for a reason, so as long as you acknowledge it, understand it and let it go while also expressing love for yourself you open up the possibility to receive and you will begin to desire what you truly need.

**Step 3** – Open up to the Possibilities. Let your positive feelings change your perspective and expectation so you can open up to the possibility that greater things will come to you. Think about your hopes, dreams, and ambitions and how they will bring good things to you. Reinforce that when you believe something will happen, it will. Make sure to be understanding and remember the Law of Attraction was always part of your life.

This step will help you have a deeper understanding of connections, your awareness, and gratitude. Make connections to where you are now and your state of mind that brought you this place. You will be able to align yourself more with it with this step. Try making a list of the good things happening to you and be appreciative and grateful for them setting you up for better things.

**Step 4** – Experience the Reality of your Desires. By this step, you have been imagining what you want and you have rid yourself of the doubt while also realizing how the law works and has worked for you before. Now it’s time to live out that desire.

This step might seem a bit weird for some people. Instead of visualizing the reality, you need to live it as much as possible. It’s like when someone talks about being rich and successful a lot and they usually end up being rich and successful. If you act like you know it will happen, or like you already have it, it will come to you.

This step is important for a few reasons. It will align you even more with your desires. Since like attracts like, if you act like you already have what you want then it will come to you easier. You will also feel a lot of gratitude when you finally get your desire and this will make your belief even stronger.

## Exercises to try

There is also a few little exercises that will help you reach your goal easier.

  * **Create a vision board**. This will help you figure out exactly what you want. Make a board filled with all the pictures or words of things that you desire. This will help make you committed to it and it will help you visualize what you want better. Every day you can look at the board and be reminded of what you desire.
  * **Sensory visualization.** As mentioned above, just use your imagination with all 5 of your senses and experience your desire as if you are already living it.
  * **Make a gratitude list.** This sets you up for success because it will put you in the right mindset to receive. Expect that the universe will be more likely to give you things if you are grateful. All you need to do is make a big list of all the things you are grateful for. You can do this physically or mentally. For instance, before you go to bed you can make a list or think about the things you are grateful for in your life right now. In the morning you can read them before you go about your day to put you in a good mood for the day ahead.
  * **Be mindful.** This will help you be more self-aware but with no judgment. Be aware of what you are thinking and feeling. But don’t analyze it, just observe it. This works with fears, too. Just observe them with love and before long they won’t be fears anymore.
  * **Do loving and kindness meditation.** This type of meditation will help send out compassion to yourself and others. It is a great mediation to do to get into the right mindset.
  * **Be intentional.** Lots of times we do things without thinking. It will help to be more intentional with your thoughts, feelings, and actions. It will make you more used to how the law of Attraction works. It’s easy to, just set your intention on doing something and then do it.
  * **Free yourself.** We are too used to thinking and caring about what others will think of us. Just be yourself and don’t care about what others think.

After all of that, it might seem like a lot but once you start you will realize how easy it is. Just keep persisting and your desires will come to you. Everybody sees results at different times so use patience and persistence and it will come. If you start doubting them go back to step 2. Continue to express gratitude and be positive. Your awareness and understanding of this law will help you to attract more of what you desire but remember it will work with or without your intention.

## What can you Apply it to in your Life?

Now that you know what it is and how to use it, you might be questioning what you can bring into your life. Well, the short answer is basically anything you want. You just need to follow the steps above and have an intention for what it is you want. You can use it to attract money, manifest love, and relationships in your life, improve your health, spiritual awakening, and to bring more fun into your life.
