COMPONENTS OF A SYSTEM BR MR. DANNY OTANGA OF UNIVERSITY OF ELDORET.  
Hello folks, lets review some of the components of a system.

Here we go:

**Entity: is an object of interest in the system  
Dynamic objects — get created, move around, change status, affect and are affected by other entities, leave (maybe)  
Usually have multiple realizations floating around  
Can have different types of entities concurrently.  
**  
Attribute: is a characteristic of all entities, but with a specific value “local” to the entity that can differ from one entity to another.</p> 

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Resources:</span> what entities compete for  
Entity seizes a resource, uses it, releases it  
Think of a resource being assigned to an entity, rather than an entity “belonging to” a resource  
“A” resource can have several units of capacity which can be changed during the simulation

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Variable:</span> A piece of information that reflects some characteristic of the whole system, not of specific entities  
&nbsp;Entities can access, change some variables

State: A collection of variables that contains all the information necessary to describe the system at any time

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Event:</span></strong> An instantaneous occurrence that changes the state of the system

&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;">Activity:</span></strong> represents a time period of specified length.
