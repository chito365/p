There are no visual obstacles in the  
development of these relations; partners can  
talk easily almost about anything. Do not feel  
any danger from the other partner. Strong  
sides of the partners are different so that  
conversations are often one-sided, falling into  
the area of the confidence of only one of the  
partners. Partners have similar problems  
making them sympathetic towards each other  
instead of critical. Collaboration between may  
be fruitful if partners feel a mutual attraction.  
Arguments are not common. The partners  
usually try to help each other; however, their  
help is not always effective because they each  
have similar problems. Can normally bring a  
feeling of satisfaction if partner is equal and  
not boring.
