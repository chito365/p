</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;">
  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">All processors since about 1985 use pipelining to overlap the execution of instructions and improve performance. This potential overlap among instructions is called instruction-level parallelism (ILP), since the instructions can be evaluated in parallel.</span>
</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;">
  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">We start by looking at the limitation imposed by data and control hazards and then turn to the topic of increasing the ability of the compiler and the processor to exploit parallelism.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;">
  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">There are two largely separable approaches to exploiting ILP:&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;">
  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">(1) an approach that relies on hardware to help discover and exploit the parallelism dynamically,</span>
</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;">
  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">and&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;">
  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">(2) an approach that relies on software technology to find parallelism statically at compile time.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p class="p0" style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;">
  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">Processors using the dynamic, hardware-based approach, including the Intel Core series, dominate in the desktop and server markets. In the personal mobile device market, where energy efficiency is often the key objective, designers exploit lower levels of instruction-level parallelism. Thus, in 2011, most processors for the PMD market use static approaches, as we will see in the ARM Cortex-A8; however, future processors (e.g., the new ARM Cortex-A9) are using dynamic approaches. Aggressive compiler-based approaches have been attempted numerous times beginning in the 1980s and most recently in the Intel Itanium series. Despite enormous efforts, such approaches have not been successful outside of the narrow range of scientific applications.</span>

<p class="p0" style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;">
  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">In the past few years, many of the techniques developed for one approach have been exploited within a design relying primarily on the other. We introduce the basic concepts and both approaches.&nbsp;</span>

  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">A discussion of the limitations on ILP approaches, and it was such limitations that directly led to the movement to multicore. Understanding the limitations remains important in balancing the use of ILP and thread-level parallelism.</span>

<p class="p0" style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;">
  <span style="font-family:'MyriadMM-700-600-';font-size:17.3333339691162px;font-weight:bold;">We discuss features of both programs and processors that limit the amount of parallelism that can be exploited among instructions, as well as the critical mapping between program structure and hardware structure, which is key to understanding whether a program property will actually limit performance and under what circumstances.</span>
