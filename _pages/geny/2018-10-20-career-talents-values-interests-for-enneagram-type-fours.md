## So, what DO Judy Garland and Søren Kierkegaard have in common, both  
being Enneagram type Fours?

All Fours want to be seen as unique, special, one-of-a-kind. They long for deep emotional  
connection both with their own interior world and with other people. Fours are often the deep sea  
divers of the psyche, the unconscious and the inner world. They want to understand themselves  
and others on a deep, authentic, soul level. Fours are sensitive to their own and other people’s  
pain and suffering. When they get out of their self-absorption and idealizations of their fantasy  
self they actually can be quite self-revealing and inspirational. Fours feel most alive when they  
are authentically, creatively expressing their uniqueness through their own personal experiences  
and passionate feelings. **Doesn’t that sound like both Judy Garland and Søren**  
**Kierkegaard?**

Fours can have either a Three wing or a Five wing. Judy Garland is a Four with a  
Three wing and Søren Kierkegaard is a Four with a Five wing. If, after clicking on the  
previous links, you feel that you are more of a Four with a strong Three wing, look at what  
Enneagram type Threes need for career satisfaction as well. If you feel you are more of a Four  
with a strong Five wing, look at what Enneagram type Fives need for career satisfaction as well.  
**Average to unhealthy Fours** are often drawn to jobs where they can be recognized as  
special, individualistic, aesthetic, exotic, elegant, sophisticated, mysterious or where they can just  
blend into the woodwork and go unnoticed because of self-worth issues. Because average to  
unhealthy Fours can suffer from low self-esteem, they often take mundane jobs that don’t  
interest them just so they can pursue their creative interests outside of work.  
**Healthy Fours** are drawn to work that allows full expression of their gifts and talents  
through some distinctive, original, personal work that inspires others or has resonance for&nbsp;everyone. Healthy Fours are imaginative, creative and self-aware. Some are even mystical and  
visionary. They enjoy communicating the inner stirrings of their heart and their unique way of  
viewing life with the rest of the world. They also have a great desire to reduce, prevent and  
eliminate unnecessary pain and suffering in life. Examples of healthy Fours are Kahlil Gibran,  
Martha Graham, Edgar Allan Poe, Joni Mitchell, Marlon Brando, Frederick Chopin,  
Tchaikovsky, Alan Watts, Johnny Depp, Thomas Merton, Herman Hesse, Walt Whitman,  
Anaïs Nin, Tennessee Williams, Anne Rice, Debbie Ford, Gangaji, Wayne Dyer, William  
Shakespeare and William Blake.
