his is intended as a general overview of various options on how to handle issues and will be a bit more verbose than the acronym soup that may be seen at times:

Emotional Intelligence &#8211; Taking from the book, &#8220;Emotional Intelligence 2.0,&#8221; there are 4 categories under this heading:

1. Self-Awareness &#8211; This is about being aware of one&#8217;s state. Is there enough energy to complete a task? Does one need more clothes? Food? Water? This is basically the piece of understanding where is one.

2. Self-Management &#8211; This is about changing one&#8217;s state. For example, would doing a power pose in changing one&#8217;s physiology( <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en&fbclid=IwAR2V5p6p2K11NHih7OoQGSQJ3bySpgijkS0Vyp-D0mV6FC51S4xNCXrX5Mc" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" data-lynx-mode="asynclazy" data-lynx-uri="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Famy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are%3Flanguage%3Den%26fbclid%3DIwAR2V5p6p2K11NHih7OoQGSQJ3bySpgijkS0Vyp-D0mV6FC51S4xNCXrX5Mc&h=AT20JaBN8lUKvSMazmbWWKuBfo6ualnSJL7IbyNB4KuO8DeZ-WNdABstVkuAdHzcWMV_fu0cIiM6i57bKJHvhbpSh37JQlb_gBH3Pdrl9AMbaMoJGRIcBP3K-ZLw8SGtRKF7">https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en</a> being the TED Talk on this) help the situation? What language is being used(See NLP for more on this)? Lastly, what quality questions could be used here to move things forward? (These 3 questions are taken from the Higher Laws materials I have under the heading of &#8220;State Management&#8221; which is really the same thing here.)

3. Social Awareness &#8211; This is awareness of one&#8217;s surroundings. Are others nearby upset, happy, or something else? What is the sense of the room? This is about understanding an environment.

4. Relationship Management &#8211; This would be about how we relate to others and handle building and maintaining bonds.

Cognitive Behavior Therapy &#8211; This is about &#8220;retrain the brain&#8221; to my mind where the idea is to form new neural pathways to handle the case of something coming up. Thought Journals are a common tool used to get the evidence for and against a particular thought. &#8220;I&#8217;m smart&#8221; would be something that one could look for proof on each side in order to change how that thought is taken, where it isn&#8217;t hard to imagine various negative thoughts where one may want some assistance. There can be support groups that use this kind of therapy in sharing tools and techniques to combat depression and anxiety for example.

Dialectic Behavior Therapy &#8211; This is about Mindfulness and being in the moment. Rather than focusing on the past or future, taking what is right here and now. Examining what are one&#8217;s senses passing along. Gratitude can also be a tool in this area to help change things.

Belief Re-Patterning &#8211; Suze Casey in Calgary would be the expert on this that I know and have used the technique in her book to keep my thoughts positive. There is a 6 step sequence of Forgiveness, Permission, Choice, Freedom, Affirmation and Surrender to go through to change what the subconscious mind is playing on its tapes over and over.

Neuro-Linguistic Programming &#8211; This has 4 pillars similar to Emotional Intelligence: Rapport, Sensory Awareness, Outcome Thinking and Behavioral Flexibility. There are tools here like Anchors where one takes an action and ties it to a specific thought. For example, if one imagines a circle where they would be able to access their superpowers then there could be an anchor of taking a step to trigger the shift of feeling more confident. This is similar to the power pose idea mentioned under Emotional Intelligence.

Constellation Therapy &#8211; This would be a therapy I&#8217;ve seen done and can explain some parts of it. There is a person that has a question or intention at the start and a facilitator that will be working like Sherlock Holmes in figuring out what is behind it. There is usually a group of people that are known as &#8220;reps&#8221; that will represent various pieces to this puzzle. The first rep is the person with the intention whereas after that, people coming into the constellation may be another person, someone&#8217;s heart, someone&#8217;s body, a secret, the sun, a country or even God in some cases. Very exotic therapy though also really cool to see the resolution that can happen once the case is cracked as the facilitator figures out what is going on and how to move forward. Perhaps there is some forgiveness somewhere or some curse to be broken.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy &#8211; Heard of this and maybe someone more comfortable with filling in some details may pick this up later.

Exposure Therapy &#8211; First, there is usually a scale here in terms of how the issue could be framed. For example, for overcoming phone anxiety, one could schedule a call to a friend as a way to give some comfort and build confidence before moving on to other pieces like calling someone out of the blue that may well trigger anxiety for a person.
