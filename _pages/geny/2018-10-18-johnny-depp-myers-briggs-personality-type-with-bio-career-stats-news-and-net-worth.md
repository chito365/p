    <p>
      Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of his day and age in Hollywood.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      He was born John Christopher Depp II in Owensboro, Kentucky, on June 9, 1963, to Betty Sue (Wells), who worked as a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Depp was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named &#8216;The Kids&#8217;. However, it was when he married Lori Anne Allison (Lori A. Depp) that he took up the job of being a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp&#8217;s film debut in the low-budget horror film, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street (1987).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Edward Scissorhands (1990). Following the film&#8217;s success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of Ed Wood (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film Donnie Brasco (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film The Astronaut&#8217;s Wife (1999). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in Sleepy Hollow (1999), brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in From Hell (2001). He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez&#8217;s &#8220;mariachi&#8221; trilogy, Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003). In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film&#8217;s enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the Stephen King-based movie, Secret Window (2004); as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based Finding Neverland (2004), where he co-starred with Kate Winslet; and Rochester in the British film, The Libertine (2004). Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of Roald Dahl&#8217;s novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), and later in Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Dark Shadows (2012).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Off-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to Sherilyn Fenn, Jennifer Grey, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss. He was married to Lori Anne Allison in 1983, but divorced her in 1985. Depp has two children with French singer/actress Vanessa Paradis: Lily-Rose Melody, born in 1999 and Jack, born in 2002. He married actress/producer Amber Heard in 2015.

    Johnny&#8217;s family has lived in Kentucky for many generations, and many of his antecedents have lived in the United States, in general, since the 1600s. His ancestry includes English, as well as Irish, Scots-Irish, Scottish, Welsh, French, Dutch, Belgian (Flemish), and German. Also, in 2013, researchers for Ancestry.com established that Johnny has remote African ancestry; they traced his lineage back to Elizabeth Key, a biracial woman, born c. 1630, who was the first woman of African ancestry to successfully sue to emancipate herself from slavery in the North American colonies (she emancipated her son, as well). Johnny has frequently stated that he believes that he has Cherokee, or other recent Native American, ancestry, although this ancestry has never been verified by genealogists. Asked the origin of his last name by James Lipton on Inside the Actors Studio, Depp stated, perhaps jokingly, that his name means &#8220;idiot&#8221; in German.

Vincent was going nuts over the drawings, and he started talking about The Tomb of Ligeia (1964). Then he closed the book and began to recite it to me in this beautiful voice, filling the room with huge sounds. Such passion! I looked in the book later, and it was verbatim. Word perfect. It was a great moment. I&#8217;ll never forget that.

    I&#8217;d been in high school three years, and I may have just walked in yesterday. I had, like, eight credits. I was in my third year of high school and I didn&#8217;t want to be there. I was bored out of my mind and I hated it.

    [about one of his old teachers asking for an autograph] I mean, what was I supposed to say? He&#8217;d failed me. I remember one time this teacher yelled at me so heavily in front of the entire class. He didn&#8217;t have any time for me then, and now, all of a sudden, he wants my autograph? They all thought I was going to end up a drug addict, in jail.

    I started smoking at 12, lost my virginity at 13 and did every kind of drug there was by 14. Pretty much any drug you can name, I&#8217;ve done it. I wouldn&#8217;t say I was bad or malicious, I was just curious. I certainly had my little experiences with drugs. Eventually, you see where that&#8217;s headed and you get out.

    I played rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll clubs in Florida. I was underage, but they would let me come in the back door to play, and then I&#8217;d have to leave after the first set. That&#8217;s how I made a living, at about $25 a night. At times we could make $2,100 &#8211; we used to make that for the entire group and the road crew, which is a lot.

    My father left and my mother was deeply hurt and sick physically and emotionally. That&#8217;s a very traumatic thing for a family to go through, so we all pulled together and did the best we could.

    These are the most important people in my life. You know, I would die for these people. If someone were to harm my family or a friend or somebody I love &#8211; I would eat them. I might end up in jail for 500 years &#8211; but I would eat them.

    [about his first marriage] I guess I have very traditional kinds of sensibilities about that kind of stuff &#8211; you know, a man and a woman sharing their life together and having a baby, whatever &#8211; and I think for a while I was trying to right the wrongs of my parents because they split up when I was a kid, so I thought I could do it differently &#8211; make things work. I had the right intentions, but the wrong timing &#8211; and the wrong person. But I don&#8217;t regret it; I had fun and I learned a lot.

    You know, I was married, when I was 20. It was a strong bond with someone, but I can&#8217;t necessarily say I was in love. That&#8217;s something that comes around once, man, maybe twice if you&#8217;re lucky. And I don&#8217;t know that I experienced that, let&#8217;s say, before I turned 30.

His bloody body rises straight out and then topples over, too. I heard somebody talk about having a dummy shot out of the bed, but I said, &#8220;Hey, I want to do this! It&#8217;ll be fun!

    [about A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)] I was just not what [director Wes Craven] had written for the story. He had written the part of a big, blond, beach jock, football player guy.

  <div class="soda even">
    [about The Kids in Hollywood] It was horrible. There were so many bands it was impossible to make any money. So we all got side jobs. We used to sell ads over the telephone. Telemarketing. We got $100 a week. We had to rip people off. We&#8217;d tell them they&#8217;d been chosen by so-and-so in their area to receive a grandfather clock. They would order $500 worth of these fucking things and we would send them a cheap grandfather clock. It was horrible.

    I like to think that I&#8217;m very considerate of other people&#8217;s feelings, and I was trained as a small child to always try my best at everything. I think I&#8217;m a mixture of romantic and realist. I&#8217;m a realist about some stuff, but I also wholeheartedly believe that in a society where people get divorced every five minutes you can still stay married for 50 or 75 years. It&#8217;s been done and it&#8217;s beautiful. When I see a couple celebrating their 75th wedding anniversary, I just think that it&#8217;s totally incredible.

    (About his early relationship) I don&#8217;t regret any of them. I had a good time. Most of what&#8217;s been written about me has been completely false.

I&#8217;m an old-fashioned guy who wants marriage and kids.

    [on Platoon (1986)] I went to read for Oliver Stone, and Oliver scared the shit out of me! I read for him and he said, &#8220;OK, I need you for ten weeks in the jungle.&#8221; It was a great experience.

    I made some shitty movies when I was first starting out, but I&#8217;m not embarrassed by them, especially as I didn&#8217;t think I was going to be an actor &#8211; I was just trying to make some money. I was still a musician. When I first started out I was just given the opportunity, and there was no other way to make that kind of money. Apart from crime.

    [on the difficulties of his singing in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street(2007)] The one [song] that was probably the most challenging was &#8220;Johanna [Act II]&#8221;&#8230; And as far as I was concerned, when Stephen Sondheim writes the note and it has to be held for this many beats, you do it. I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re from Miramar or Kentucky or you&#8217;re an ass and you don&#8217;t sing. It doesn&#8217;t matter. Don&#8217;t be a pussy, you fucking hold that note. You can&#8217;t cheat. You can&#8217;t whisper. You can&#8217;t do the William Shatner thing. You just gotta belt it out. So I really beat myself up, making sure I could hold those notes. In &#8220;Johanna,&#8221; some are, like, twelve beats. That was a bugger. At one point, I was very close to passing out&#8211; I got dizzy and saw black. But that&#8217;s what Sondheim wrote, so that&#8217;s what you do.

I didn&#8217;t want to sign some big contract that would bind me for years. So they hired somebody else to do it, and they fired him after about a month, and then they called me again and said, &#8220;Would you please come in and do it?&#8221; My agent said, &#8220;The average span of a TV series is thirteen episodes, if that.

It was not anything very near to my brain or my heart, which is how it pretty much remains to this day. But Wes Craven was brave enough to give me the gig based on his daughter&#8217;s opinion. I guess she had read with a bunch of actors, and after the casting sessions, she said, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s the guy.&#8221; I always think of her for putting me in this mess, and certainly Wes Craven for being brave enough to give me this gig.
