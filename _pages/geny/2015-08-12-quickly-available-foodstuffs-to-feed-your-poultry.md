\*.Grains: feed corn, sorghum, amaranth, and sunflowers. All are beautiful, boost insect diversity and support pollinators, and ripen nutritious seeds. \*.Cover crops: small grains, buckwheat, and cowpeas. \*.Chard and mangels: Chard ( Swiss chard) and mangels (fodder beets) are simply variants of garden beets, Beta vulgaris. \*.Potatoes: must be cooked \*. Comfrey: high-mineral, high-nitrogen leaves \*.Dairy byproducts: If you milk a cow or goat and make butter or cheese, skimmed or soured milk and whey are good poultry feeds. \*.Cultivated Earthworms and Soldier Grubs \*.Decomposers as live protein feeds: earthworms, black soldier flies, and carrion flies.
