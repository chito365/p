They may act more seductively, be more curious about what the Five is doing or insist that they should go out and have some fun. Unfortunately, Fives feel more suffocated and emotionally overwhelmed by the Twos actions. Fives detach emotionally and retract even more, just wanting to get away from the Two overtures and preserve their autonomy.
