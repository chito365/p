Enneagram Sixes, like Nines, probably have the greatest diversity of careers of any type. Even  
though they can be found in many different occupations there are certain occupations that they  
are drawn to because of their natural gifts, talents and values. Here is a list of some of them.

**alertness to hazards and danger. They are concerned about security, safety and justice**

**enforcement, public safety, protective service, corrections and the military. Some Sixes**  
**(phobic) do not like risky jobs and will stick with the safer of these jobs. Other Sixes**  
**(counterphobic) like to confront their fears and can feed off of the adrenaline and**  
**excitement it arouses, as if they apparently have no fear.**
