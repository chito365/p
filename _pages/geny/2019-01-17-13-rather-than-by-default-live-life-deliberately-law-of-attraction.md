We are giving this book to you to remind you of things you already know at some level, so as to reactivate that vibrational knowledge within you. It is not possible for you to read these words, which represent the knowledge that you hold from your Broader Perspective, without recognition of this knowledge beginning to surface from within.

&nbsp;

This really is the time of awakening—the time of remembering your personal power and your reason for being. So take a deep breath, make an effort to get comfortable, and slowly read the contents of this book to restore yourself to your original vibrational essence. . . .

&nbsp;

So here you are, in a wonderful state of being: no longer an infant under the control of others, somewhat acclimated into your physical environment, and now—by reading this book—returning

&nbsp;

to the recognition of the full power of your Being . . . no longer buffeted around by the _Law of Attraction_ like a small cork on a raging sea, but finally remembering and gaining control of your own destiny, finally and _deliberately_ guiding your life within the powerful _Law of Attraction_ rather than responding in an attitude of default and just taking life as it comes. _In order to do that, you have to tell a different story. You have to begin to tell the story of your life as you now <u>want </u>it to be and discontinue the tales of how it <u>has been </u>or of how_ it _<u>is.</u>_
