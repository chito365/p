A solve-it-fast guide for home, car and more. Because&#8211;sometimes&#8211;duct tape just  
isn&#8217;t enough.  
The world is populated by two kinds of guys: the ones who  
know what to do when something goes bust, and the ones  
who are always asking the first guys for help. Here&#8217;s your  
secret manual for staying on the right side of the divide. It&#8217;s  
filled with experts&#8217; shameless shortcuts for dealing with  
and water will get rid of ants,&#8221; says Amy Devers,  
ng out of hiding.&#8221;  
AR FACTOR: A weed-ridden asparagus  
as you about ready to give up on your  
crop.  
THE QUICK FIX: Add salt. &#8220;Asparagus is the only  
everything from flooded basements to mysterious oil leaks  
to flat mountain bike tires. These down-and-dirty repairs  
won&#8217;t all last a lifetime, but they can certainly save the day.  
INVADING ARMY: Ants are having a feeding  
frenzy in your kitchen, and you don&#8217;t want to use  
a toxic brew to defeat them.  
THE QUICK FIX: &#8220;A 50/50 mix of peppermint oil  
co-host of the DIY Network&#8217;s &#8220;DIY To The  
Rescue&#8221; show. &#8220;Fill a spray bottle, and spray

laptop&#8217;s power.&#8221;

SCREW LOOSE: You&#8217;re trying to replace a  
woodscrew, but the hole is stripped and the screw  
won&#8217;t grab.  
HE QUICK FIX: Insert two short lengths of thin,

Most garage door openers  
made in the past 15 years have pressure  
adjustments for both raising and lowering. Chec  
and adjust these settings seasonally to keep  
things running sm

insulated wire in the hole before adding the  
screw. They&#8217;ll allow the screw to bite.  
TRAPPED BELOW:  
bas drain dried up-and now your cellar  
smells vaguely of nasty, nasty things.  
THE QUICK FIX: Pour nontoxic plumbing  
antifreeze down the drain to fill the trap. You can  
use water in a pinch, but it evaporates faster than  
antifreeze, so you&#8217;ll need to repeat the process  
more often.  
HOT WHEELS: The temperature gauge on  
car is headed for the danger zone, but you&#8217;v  
no time (or place) to park and cool your jets  
THE QUICK FIX: Turn the heater on full bla  
pening the windows so you don&#8217;t fry). The extra

volume of the heater core and its hoses, as well  
as the airflow of the heater fan blowing across the

THE QUICK FIX: A 9-volt battery adapter can  
plug into your cigarette lighter to keep those chips  
powered up. Result: No more auto amnesia.

DAMPNESS AT NOON: Your clothes dryer  
seems to have lost its zip.  
THE QUICK FIX: Clear the vent duct by removing  
the vent pipe and pulling out any accumulated  
debris from the pipe and duct. It&#8217;s a 3-minute fix  
that can save you a $75 visit from a technician.  
UNPLANNED POOL: A big rain has flooded your  
basement. And, since it knocked out the power  
too, your usually reliable sump pump won&#8217;t pump.  
THE QUICK FIX: If you live on a slope, try  
making a siphon. First, fill a garden hose with  
water from the outside spigot. Seal one end with  
your thumb and have a friend seal the other.  
Place one end through the cellar window and into  
the standing water. Then, have your friend carry  
the other end as far downhill as possible (the  
outlet has to be below the intake). Release your  
thumbs and let gravity do the rest.  
SHAGGY LAWN: You need to cut the grass  
before the in-laws show up but your mower won&#8217;t  
start.  
THE QUICK FIX: Before you give up and take it  
to the repair shop, try this. First, take out the  
spark plug and empty the gas. Then, get a new  
plug, add some fresh gas to the tank and, more  
often than not, the mower will start right up.  
CRACKED TEETH: Someone&#8211;not you, surely&#8211;  
has broken a key off in a door lock, which is now  
jammed shut.  
THE QUICK FIX: Use a grinding wheel to shape  
an old hacksaw blade into a harpoon-like point.  
Then, slip the point into the lock over one of the  
key nubs and use the hook to fish it out.

BLURRED VISION: The zoom shots from your  
fancy new digital camera are fuzzy.  
THE QUICK FIX: Only use your optical zoom.  
Most digital cameras have both optical zoom, in  
which the lens moves (just like a zoom on a film  
camera), and digital zoom, which manipulates the  
image electronically. The digital zoom can  
compromise the quality of the image. If you want  
more magnification than the optical zoom can  
handle, it&#8217;s better to achieve it on a computer after  
the fact.  
RISING WATERS: The toilet is about to overflow,  
and you know that your usual tactic of slamming  
the lid and crossing your fingers won&#8217;t work.  
THE QUICK FIX: As soon as the water level in  
the bowl starts rising, reach into the tank and prop  
up the fill valve (the ball or cylinder that floats on  
top of the water). That will stop the flow to the  
toilet, thwarting an overflow. The plunger,  
however, still awaits.

IMMOVABLE OBJECT: A stubborn nut on an old  
lawnmower or pickup truck refuses to budge.  
THE QUICK FIX: The standard tactic since the  
dawn of the acetylene torch has been to heat the  
nut until it glows red. When heat alone won&#8217;t cut  
it, touch a candle to the glowing nut. The wax will  
melt and flow into the threads, acting as a  
lubricant.  
SNEAK LEAK: You can&#8217;t find the source of oil  
leaking from your engine.  
THE QUICK FIX: First, spray the area with Easy  
Off kitchen cleaner. (It&#8217;s cheaper than automotive  
cleaners.) Then, hose the area down, let it dry  
and spray on aerosol foot powder. The oil will  
stain a path in the powder, which you can follow  
back to its source.  
Editor&#8217;s Note: We&#8217;ve already received mail on this  
one. Yes, Easy Off can corrode aluminum, but the  
damage isn&#8217;t instantaneous. Make sure to rinse it  
off with a hose both promptly and thoroughly. Illustration by George Retseck  
SUN-DRIED TOMATOES: You need a way to  
water sensitive tomato plants during your summer  
vacation, without asking your neighbor to take  
care of them (again).  
THE QUICK FIX: Collect some liter-size plastic  
soda bottles and punch a few small holes in each  
one. Then, bury a bottle up to its neck next to  
each of the plants. Before you leave, simply fill  
the bottles; they&#8217;ll slowly release the water over  
the next four or five days and keep your plants  
from wilting.  
STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE: A broken tent pole  
is threatening to ruin your annual family camping  
trip.  
THE QUICK FIX: &#8220;As long as you don&#8217;t need it to  
hold up to serious weather, you can splint a tent  
pole with a branch,&#8221; says Michael Hodgson,  
author of Camping For Dummies. (Use medical  
tape, dental floss&#8211;or, yes, duct tape.) &#8220;Heck, you  
can even pitch a tent entirely with branches if you  
need to.&#8221;

POLTERGEIST DOOR: Every house has one, a  
door that slowly drifts shut every time you try to  
leave it open.  
THE QUICK FIX: Rather than resetting the hinges  
or propping it open with a potted plant, remove  
one of the hinge pins, lay it over a nail atop a hard  
surface, and strike it lightly with a hammer until  
the hinge pin has a slight bend. Tap the pin back  
in place. The increased friction will keep the door  
where you want it.  
TRASHED SINK: The kitchen garbage disposal is  
frozen.  
THE QUICK FIX: &#8220;Ninety-five percent of garbage  
disposals have a reset button on the motor,&#8221; says  
Chris Hall, a former appliance repairman and  
founder of Repairclinic.com. &#8220;No other appliance  
has this, so people assume they need to call a  
technician. I&#8217;ve answered literally dozens of calls  
that just needed someone to hit the reset.&#8221;

BLANK SLATE: You&#8217;ve lost the stylus to your  
PDA.  
THE QUICK FIX: Use a toothpick. It works as a  
replacement&#8211;and does double duty after dinner.  
CHILLY DEPTHS: There&#8217;s a puddle of water  
under your refrigerator, and it&#8217;s growing.  
THE QUICK FIX: &#8220;I see this all the time,&#8221; says  
Jeff McKinney, owner of JEM Plumbing and a  
member of ServiceMagic.com. &#8220;Usually, it&#8217;s  
because the icemaker line has sprung a leak.  
People don&#8217;t realize that there&#8217;s a shutoff valve.  
Typically, it&#8217;s under the sink. If not, look in the  
basement, beneath the fridge.&#8221;  
CRACK HABIT: You&#8217;ve always used Spackle to  
patch cracks in plaster walls, just like your father  
did. But the pesky fissures keep opening up.  
THE QUICK FIX: &#8220;Use a clear latex acrylic caulk,  
rather than traditional patching compounds,&#8221; says  
John Stauffer, technical director at the Paint  
Quality Institute. &#8220;The caulk has some flexibility,  
so it won&#8217;t open up if your house moves a bit.&#8221;  
DRIP SERVICE: A toilet tank is dripping and you  
can&#8217;t tell if the water is coming from harmless  
seasonal sweating or a bad seal.  
THE QUICK FIX: Dump some food coloring into  
the tank and see if the color reaches the floor. If it  
does, check the tank for cracks and the piping for  
loose connections.

SPARELESS MISTAKE: You&#8217;ve got a flat tire on  
your mountain bike, and you don&#8217;t have a spare  
inner tube.  
THE QUICK FIX: Create a makeshift inner tube  
out of leaves and grass. &#8220;It sounds absurd, but it  
really works,&#8221; says Scott Kaier, a mechanic at  
Onion River Sports in Montpelier, Vt. &#8220;Leave one  
side of the tire bead hooked on the rim, and cram  
the opening with as much soft stuff as you can  
find. Install the other bead, and away you go.&#8221; At  
least it will get you home.  
CHIMNEY SEEP: No matter what you do, the  
paint on your masonry chimney keeps peeling.  
THE QUICK FIX: Install a galvanized (good),  
stainless (better) or copper (best) rain cap. These  
start at about $30 and are available in most home  
repair and building supply outlets. &#8220;Peeling  
chimney paint is almost always caused by water  
working its way from the inside, out,&#8221; explains  
John Stauffer, technical director at the Paint  
Quality Institute. &#8220;A rain cap will keep the bulk of  
the water out of the flue.&#8221;

A TWO-WEEKEND PAINT JOB: You want to put  
away your paint-laden rollers and brushes without  
cleaning them.  
THE QUICK FIX: Wrap the painting utensils  
tightly in a plastic bag and stick them in the  
freezer. Once thawed, they&#8217;ll be ready to use.  
Caveat: Paint is for painting, not eating. Be sure  
to seal the bag tightly to eliminate any chance of  
food contamination.  
FLUID LOSS: Your radiator is leaking, you&#8217;re in  
the middle of nowhere, and there&#8217;s no repair shop  
in sight.  
THE QUICK FIX: Dump in a small container of  
ground black pepper. The pepper won&#8217;t dissolve,  
but instead will remain in suspension. This allows  
it to temporarily plug minor leaks, buying you  
enough time to get to the shop.  
CROSSED SIGNALS: You&#8217;re constantly getting  
kicked off the wireless link on your home  
computer network.  
THE QUICK FIX: Other devices are probably  
interfering. If you have a 2.4-GHz cordless phone,  
switch to a 900-MHz, or a newer 5.8-GHz, model.  
These phones operate on different frequencies  
than your wireless router. (Some 2.4-GHz phones  
allow you to change frequencies&#8211;check your  
owner&#8217;s manual.) Microwave ovens can also  
disrupt your wireless signal.
