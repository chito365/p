The MBTI ® “Letter Dichotomies” refer to the pairs of psychological preferences—represented by letters such as “I” or “E”—that most type tests force you to choose between. The letters and their corresponding explanations are as follows:

                                              Of course, if all of these categories were mutually exclusive, the world would be in trouble. Introverts would never leave their homes. Extroverts would never leave parties. Intuitives would lack the ability to see, hear, taste and touch the world around them. Sensors would be helpless to form plans or strategize.
                                            </p>
                                            
                                            <p>
                                              The truth about type is that it’s significantly more complicated than sorting people into categories such as “Feeler” or “Thinker.” Personality type, at its core, is a reflection of how you process information and reach decisions. Sometimes you do this by venturing into the world and gathering new information. Sometimes you do this by withdrawing and analyzing what you have available to you. Each of our brains processes thoughts, feelings and experiences a little differently. And those different methods of gathering and processing information are known as our cognitive functions.
