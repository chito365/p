**Are you more like a Five with a Four-wing or a Five with a Six-wing? Read below to find**  
**out.**

## Type Five with a Four Wing (5w4)

**Positive:**  
• Imaginative, Curious, Original  
• Intuitive, Inventive, Abstract  
• More empathic, introspective, and sensitive to feelings than 5w6s  
• Humanistic, personal quality  
• Intellectual & Emotional, Quiet  
• Philosophical, Creative, Arty  
**Negative:**  
• Self-absorbed, Hypersensitive  
• Moody, Isolated, Melancholy  
**Type Five with a Four Wing:** Fives with a Four wing (5w4s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Fours than of Sixes (the other wing), although both wings (4 and 6) can influence  
their personality. 5w4s tend to be more emotional, passionate, creative, intuitive, introspective  
and self-aware than 5w6s owing to their 4 wing. Healthy 5w4s are interested in exploring a niche  
that has never been explored before or in some way expressing their own unique personal vision.  
5w4s can blend the curiosity and perceptiveness of the 5 with the creativity and imagination of  
the 4 to envision alternate realities that have never been conceived of before. 5w4s have more of  
an abstract, otherworldly thought process than 5w6s and are often drawn to artistic fields,  
philosophy and/or invention. They enjoy reading, solving mental puzzles such as Sudoku, playing  
intellectual games of strategy such as scrabble and bridge, and often specialize in trivia.

Negatively, 5w4s can be independent lone wolfs who struggle with intense feelings and  
melancholic moods. They can be overly sensitive to criticism as well as their environment. They  
can live in their heads and become oblivious to the outer world as they try to find a solution to a  
problem they are mentally working on. They are the quintessential “absentminded professor”  
type. They can be highly impractical in worldly affairs and ungrounded. They can have difficulty  
sustaining their work efforts if they get overwhelmed by the doldrums and become dejected and  
despondent. They can be attracted to shadowy, taboo, dark and disturbing subject matter.  
Some withdrawn 5w4s can suffer from existential angst and severe depression.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Five with a Six wing also (see below).  
However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions. See if you  
can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference might be.

## Type Five with a Six Wing (5w6)

**Positive:**  
• Hardworking, Loyal, Scientific  
• Analytical, Intellectual, Logical  
• Drawn to technical subjects like engineering, science, invention  
• Organized and Disciplined  
• Blend Innovation & Business  
• Practical, Cooperative, Reliable  
**Negative:**  
• Anxious, Socially Awkward  
• Skeptical, Afraid of Intimacy  
**Type Five with a Six Wing:** Fives with a Six wing (5w6s) tend to take on more of the attributes  
of Sixes than of Fours (the other wing), although both wings (6 and 4) can influence their  
personality. 5w6s tend to be more cooperative, disciplined, practical, detail-oriented, scientific,  
technical and security-conscious than 5w4s. 5w6s can combine their keen observation skills with  
their ability to organize and synthesize data to make startling predictions based on the facts they  
have gathered. This is the most purely intellectual and analytical type in the Enneagram. They  
are excellent problem solvers who are able to dissect something into its component parts to  
discover how it works or see where the problem lies. They often like to work behind the scenes in  
a niche that will provide them stability and security. They are often drawn to subjects such as:  
engineering, science, law, computer programming, repair work, and inventing. They are hardworking  
and many become experts in their field. Counterphobic 5w6s are courageous and antiauthoritarian  
and may feel a sense of mission.

Negatively, 5w6s can be overly private about their feelings. They can also be defensive,  
argumentative and antagonistic toward people who disagree with their views, beliefs and  
theories. 5w6s can sometimes lack the introspective quality of 5w4s. They can have awkward  
social skills and be a bit nerdy. Negative 5w6s can be information junkies who spend lots of time  
reading and very little time taking action. Negative 5w6s can be very suspicious of other people’s  
motives. They can be misanthropic, cold and extremely skeptical.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Five with a Four wing also (see  
above). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions.  
See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference  
might be.
