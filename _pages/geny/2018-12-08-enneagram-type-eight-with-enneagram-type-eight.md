**For Eights**

  * The best-selling author of “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People” once said, “If down deep you are invulnerable you can afford to be vulnerable on the surface of your But if down deep you are vulnerableyou can’t afford to be vulnerable.” If you are an Eight reading these words your goal is to develop your inner invulnerability. Use your desire to protect yourself as a catalyst to protect others. Like begets like so your confrontational stance begets confrontation from others and only reinforces your view that the world is a cold nd unjust place. You like to be powerful so use your strength to empower others.
