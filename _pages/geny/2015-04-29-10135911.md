Steps in a Simulation Study Problem formulation Clearly state the problem. Setting of objectives and overall project plan How we should approach the problem. Model conceptualization Establish a reasonable model. Data collection Collect the data necessary to run the simulation (such as arrival rate, arrival process, service discipline, service rate etc.). Model translation Conver the model into a programming language. Verification Verify the model by checking if the program works properly. Use common sense. Validation Check if the system accurately represent the real system. Experimental design How many runs? For how long? What kind of input variations? Production runs and analysis Actual running the simulation, collect and analize the output. Repeatition Repeat the experiments if necessary. Document and report Document and report the results.
