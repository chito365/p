As can be seen from the above, some ENFPs can have difficulty fitting into society. Their problems are often due top feeling different from others because of their dominant Intuition, and being unable to stick to anything long enough to feel a sense of accomplishment. They feel like they don’t fit in, and can’t find the place where they belong in the world. The ENFP who consistently makes decisions and applies classifications to their ideas will be able to turn their ideas into reality, and experience the feelings of accomplishment and success that accompany being effective.

&nbsp;

The key to personal growth for the ENFP is competent execution of Introverted Feeling. It’s difficult for most to understand what this means, much less incorporate that directive into your life. &nbsp;I have created some action-oriented suggestions that will help lead you down the path towards more effective use of the Introverted Feeling function. Specific suggestions:

&nbsp;

When you feel angry or resistant towards someone who you feel is criticizing you, take this as a cue that &nbsp;you are not judging effectively. &nbsp;When that happens, take a step back from your anger and try to really hear what the person is saying objectively. &nbsp;Rather than expending mental energy in defining how the other person is wrong, try to judge what the person is actually saying.

&nbsp;

Periodically make lists of goals and accomplishments. Revisit your goals and accomplishments as often as you’d like to maintain a sense of direction.

&nbsp;

Spend time alone regularly for the purpose of thinking through issues in your life.
