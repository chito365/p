ISTP’s usually have a loyal group of friends that they fit in with and feel comfortable with. The problems that ISTP’s have with regards to fitting into our world are not usually related to platonic friendships. Usually, the ISTP has trouble finding and maintaining a love relationship. The ISTP usually has very simple needs and expectations from their mates, and they&#8217;re surprised and confused to find that their mates have more complex demands. They feel inadequate to meeting their mate&#8217;s needs, and begin to get very uncomfortable with the situation as they perceive that they are expected to do something that it unknown to them. They back away from the relationship. Outside of a relationship, they feel more unloved and unappreciated, but are afraid to commit to a relationship because they fear rejection and hurt.

&nbsp;

**Specific** **suggestions:**

Don&#8217;t expect yourself to be a master at the &#8220;touchy-feely&#8221; game. Be yourself, but remember that there is a basic assumption of human decency that must be adhered to in relationships. If you&#8217;re not sure what that means, take special care to observe how people in &#8220;good&#8221; committed relationships behave towards each other, so that you can determine where the lines are drawn.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Pair yourself with an Extraverted Thinker (ESTJ or ENTJ) who is less likely to assume that the lack of feedback is the same thing as negative feedback.

&nbsp;

Expanding your world and experiences will expand your understanding of human expectations. Try to figure out the personality type of people that you know and encounter in your life.

&nbsp;

Don&#8217;t fear the unknown. You can handle it.
