<div class="link-dn">
  These relations are the most favourable and comfortable of all intertype relations providing complete psychological compatibility. Dual partners are like two halves of a whole unit.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<img src="http://www.socionics.com/rel/common/graph/rel.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" /> [Identical Relations](http://www.socionics.com/rel/idn.htm){.nav-link2}

<div class="link-dn">
  These are relations of complete understanding between partners but with an inability to help each other.
</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<pre>Outcomes:</pre>

<div class="link-dn">
  <img src="http://www.socionics.com/rel/common/graph/rel.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" /><a class="nav-link2" href="http://www.socionics.com/rel/act.htm">Relations of Activity</a>
</div>

<div class="link-dn">
  These relations are the easiest and quickest to start. Activity partners do not experience any visual difficulties when starting relations which can be surprising to them at the beginning.
</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<pre>Outcomes: 1-1,</pre>

<img src="http://www.socionics.com/rel/common/graph/rel.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" /> [Mirror Relations](http://www.socionics.com/rel/mrr.htm){.nav-link2}

<div class="link-dn">
  These are relations of mutual correction. Mirror partners have similar interests and ideas, but a slightly different understanding of the same problems.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<pre>Outcomes:</pre>

<img src="http://www.socionics.com/rel/common/graph/rel.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" /> [Relations of Semi-Duality](http://www.socionics.com/rel/sdl.htm){.nav-link2}

<div class="link-dn">
  These are relations of deficient Duality. Semi-Duality partners usually have no problems in understanding each other or each other&#8217;s objectives, at least when these objectives are only on paper.
</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<pre>Outcomes:</pre>

<img src="http://www.socionics.com/rel/common/graph/rel.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" /> [Comparative Relations](http://www.socionics.com/rel/cmp.htm){.nav-link2}

<div class="link-dn">
  These are relations of deceptive similarity. Comparative partners talk about similar things, have similar interests, obey the norms of politeness and hospitality towards each other.
</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<pre>Outcomes:</pre>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<img src="http://www.socionics.com/rel/common/graph/rel.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" /> [Conflicting Relations](http://www.socionics.com/rel/cnf.htm){.nav-link2}

<div class="link-dn">
  These are relations of constantly developing conflict. Conflicting relations have the worst compatibility between partners among all other relations.
</div>

<pre>Outcomes:</pre>

<img src="http://www.socionics.com/rel/common/graph/rel.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" /> [Super-Ego Relations](http://www.socionics.com/rel/ego.htm){.nav-link2}

<div class="link-dn">
  These are relations of mutual respect between partners. Super-Ego partners may think of each other as a distant and slightly mysterious ideal. They often show interest in each other&#8217;s manners and behaviour.
</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<pre>Outcomes:</pre>

<div class="link-dn">
  These are relations of major misunderstanding. Quasi-Identical partners can interact with each other in a more or less peaceful manner if both partners are Thinking types.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<pre>Outcomes:</pre>

<img src="http://www.socionics.com/rel/common/graph/rel.jpg" align="left" vspace="3" /> [Contrary Relations](http://www.socionics.com/rel/cnt.htm){.nav-link2}

</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>

<pre>Outcomes:</pre>

</div>

  &nbsp;
</div>
