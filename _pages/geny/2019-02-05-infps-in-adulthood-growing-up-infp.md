From the age of approximately thirty onwards, INFPs begin to develop their inferior function, extroverted thinking. This function helps the INFP to set and accomplish concrete goals, back up their opinions logically and bridge the gap between their dreams and their everyday life.

As they age, INFPs will become increasingly comfortable honing in on their creative interests and bringing major projects to fruition. Whereas they may have once felt threatened by having any sort of structure or limitations placed on their creativity, they will grow into the understanding that a certain amount of structure is not only helpful but necessary in order to translate their passions and ideals into realities.

Many INFPs find that they are most productive and accomplished in their later years. Extroverted thinking helps this type to advocate for themselves— where they may once have balked at the thought of drawing attention to their creative work (wanting to be discovered authentically), extroverted thinking helps this type to become more comfortable promoting themselves and their work.

While adulthood certainly brings about a variety of changes in the INFP’s demeanor, this type does not ever abandon their core nature. INFPs don’t grow out of their passionate, artistic personalities as they age—they grow and mature into them. Each year builds steadily on this type’s pre-existing set of core values and passions—incrementally revealing the true depth and brilliance of the INFP type.
