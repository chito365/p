Most people don’t have a personal mission statement which is why I am including some here  
based on each Enneagram type’s innate gifts, talents, interests and values. A personal mission  
statement is nothing more than a brief written statement of your overall purpose in life, your  
personal vision for who you want to be in and for the world. Helen Keller once said, “The most  
pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but has no vision.” I would use the word  
pitiable (as in evoking compassion) instead of pathetic but otherwise I agree with her. Without a  
“why” to live for that makes a contribution life quickly becomes empty and meaningless.

#1. My mission is to allow events to unfold in their own natural way without seeking to shape  
or manipulate them. Ease and tranquility is available to all at any time.  
#2. My mission is to help create world peace by accepting myself and others just the way we  
are.  
#3. My mission is to help people grow and develop so they can express more and more of their  
full human potential.  
#4. My mission is to help abandoned animals find a loving home.  
#5. My mission is to create original works of art that are an authentic expression of my soul.  
#6. My mission is to help clients gain self-understanding, peace of mind, and harmony within  
themselves, their relationships and their lives.  
#7. My mission is to help people develop their spiritual side and ultimately realize our oneness.  
#8. My mission is to help each of my clients find a job that is a good fit for his/her personality.  
#9. My mission is to make crafts that are attractive as well as useful to people.  
#10. My mission is to help people heal both physically and emotionally after a crisis.  
#11. My mission is to help people better understand the symbolism of their dreams.
