**INTJ**

They have a particular skill at grasping difficult, complex concepts and building  
strategies.

**1.Scientists**

There are many different kinds of scientists, and they all do different things. Some like to learn about living organisms. They are called biologists. Others like to study rocks. We call them geologists. People who study animals are sometimes called zoologists &#8211; this is easy to remember because sometimes animals live in zoos.

Scientists are very curious people who like to solve problems. They solve these problems by doing science projects called experiments. What are some of these problems? Well, they can be about keeping our air clean or finding a way to cure people when they have certain diseases.

So what do scientists do specifically? Well, it all boils down to observing, measuring, and communicating. Let&#8217;s take a look.

## What Do Scientists Do? {#section---WhatDoScientistsDo}

Scientists **observe** things. Our senses can help us observe what is around us. Scientists use their senses when solving science problems. They use their eyes to spot details. They use their noses to detect if something is stinky. They use their hearing, touch, and even sense of taste.

Scientists **measure** things. Have you ever measured something with a ruler to see how long it is? Scientists do that. Have you ever stood on a scale? If so, you&#8217;ve measured your weight.
