1. Allows me to work with people who are hard working, reliable, responsible, competent,  
ethical and dedicated to doing excellent work.  
2. Allows me to work with a boss who is dependable, fair, consistent and has integrity.  
3. Encourages me to fix or improve things that I naturally notice aren’t working or could be  
done better.  
4. Allows me to work at my own pace so that I can meet my own high standards for doing  
the job right, not just getting it done.  
5. Allows me to be precise and meticulous about details.  
6. Rewards competence, conscientiousness, thoroughness and accuracy.  
7. Has meaning and value for me beyond a paycheck.  
8. Does not require me to make pivotal decisions on the basis of fluctuating or partial  
information.  
9. Doesn’t require that I work under a tight, pressured deadline that might cause me to make  
mistakes.  
10. Won’t leave me feeling that what I do is never good enough.  
11. Is relatively stress-free (because I already tend to get anxious and take things too  
seriously as it is!)  
12. Doesn’t requires me to compromise my ethical values!
