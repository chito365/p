<div>
  <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><strong>Direct manipulation</strong></span> is a User interface design style which involves continuous representation of objects of interest and rapid, reversible, and incremental actions & feedback.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-family:Verdana;">The intention is to allow a user to directly manipulate objects presented to them, using actions that correspond at least loosely to the physical world.&nbsp;</span>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-family:Verdana;">An example of direct-manipulation is resizing a graphical shape, such as a rectangle, by dragging its corners or edges with a mouse.</span>
</div>

<div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana;">Having real-world metaphors for objects and actions can make it easier for a user to learn and use an interface (some might say that the interface is more natural or intuitive) e.g. Traffic Message Channel (TMC) is a technology for delivering traffic and travel information to drivers</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana;">Rapid, incremental feedback allows a user to make fewer errors and complete tasks in less time, because they can see the results of an action before completing the action, thus evaluating the output and compensating for mistakes.</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <div>
      <span style="font-family:Verdana;">Direct manipulation interfaces are almost always designed to operate in a windows environment.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span style="font-family:Verdana;">They are typically designed around a desktop metaphor, meaning that users are meant to view the interface as if it were their own desk consisting of a flat surface upon which files are arrayed.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span style="font-family:Verdana;">Software tools such as scissors, tape and notepads are present.</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <div>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana;">The main features of direct manipulation interfaces are the use of graphic onscreen icons that represent actions, programs and files available in the system.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana;">The figure below presents a sample of such an interface.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana;">They are called direct manipulation because there are no intermediaries (such as commands or menus) between the user and the work to be performed.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana;">The user works directly on the screen which displays information.&nbsp;</span>
  </div>
