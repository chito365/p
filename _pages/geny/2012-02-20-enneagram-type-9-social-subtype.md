Can resemble 7s because they can be very busy, constantly on the go, energetic, optimistic and  
frequently scattered.

**Positive/Enhancing:**

• They are usually quite energetic and like to stay active  
• They like to get involved in groups that further social causes  
• Group involvement helps social 9s to structure the use of their time better  
• The positive energy of group involvement invigorates and enlivens them  
• They enjoy bringing people together and being part of what’s going on  
• They avoid participating in group conflicts if at all possible

**Negative/Depleting:**

• Inner tension between wanting to fully participate in a group vs. not wanting the  
responsibility of fully participating  
• They don’t like having too many expectations or duties placed on them by the group  
• Often will stay on the periphery or the fringe of group involvement so they don’t have to  
fully commit  
• Can sometimes be indecisive about whether they want to belong to a group or not  
• Can be stubborn and/or withdrawn, especially if someone is being demanding, bossy or  
rude  
• Can zone out mentally and disengage emotionally while still remaining physically  
present/involved  
• Can be fairly conventional and conforming; many don’t like to go beyond the limits  
• Fearful of losing their identity and becoming just like everybody else; they desire to be  
something bigger  
• Can have difficulty saying no because they like to please and want to belong/fit in (unless  
they have a strong 8 wing. Then they can say no)  
• Can have trouble setting their own goals and following through with their innermost  
intentions  
• At worst, can become resigned, emotionally dead yet needy, depressed, angry and socially  
isolated
