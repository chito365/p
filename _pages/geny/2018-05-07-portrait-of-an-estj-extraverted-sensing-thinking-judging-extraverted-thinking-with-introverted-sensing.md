As an ESTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.

&nbsp;

ESTJ&#8217;s live in a world of facts and concrete needs. They live in the present, with their eye constantly scanning their personal environment to make sure that everything is running smoothly and systematically. They honor traditions and laws, and have a clear set of standards and beliefs. They expect the same of others, and have no patience or understanding of individuals who do not value these systems. They value competence and efficiency, and like to see quick results for their efforts.

&nbsp;

ESTJ’s are take-charge people. They have such a clear vision of the way that things should be, that they naturally step into leadership roles. They are self-confident and aggressive. They are extremely talented at devising systems and plans for action, and at being able to see what steps need to be taken to complete a specific task. They can sometimes be very demanding and critical, because they have such strongly held beliefs, and are likely to express themselves without reserve if they feel someone isn&#8217;t meeting their standards. But at least their expressions can be taken at face-value, because the ESTJ is extremely straight- forward and honest.

&nbsp;

The ESTJ is usually a model citizen, and pillar of the community. He or she takes their commitments seriously, and follows their own standards of &#8220;good citizenship&#8221; to the letter. ESTJ enjoys interacting with people, and likes to have fun. ESTJ’s can be very boisterous and fun at social events, especially activities which are focused on the family, community, or work.

&nbsp;

The ESTJ needs to watch out for the tendency to be too rigid, and to become overly detail-oriented. Since they put a lot of weight in their own beliefs, it&#8217;s important that they remember to value other people&#8217;s input and opinions. If they neglect their Feeling side, they may have a problem with fulfilling other&#8217;s needs for intimacy, and may unknowingly hurt people&#8217;s feelings by applying logic and reason to situations which demand more emotional sensitivity.

&nbsp;

When bogged down by stress, an ESTJ often feels isolated from others. They feel as if they are misunderstood and undervalued, and that their efforts are taken for granted. Although normally the ESTJ is very verbal and doesn&#8217;t have any problem expressing themselves, when under stress they have a hard time putting their feelings into words and communicating them to others.

&nbsp;

ESTJ’s value security and social order above all else, and feel obligated to do all that they can to enhance and promote these goals. They will mow the lawn, vote, join the PTA, attend home owner’s association meetings, and generally do anything that they can to promote personal and social security.

&nbsp;

The ESTJ puts forth a lot of effort in almost everything that they do. They will do everything that they &nbsp;&nbsp;think should be done in their job, marriage, and community with a good amount of energy. He or she is conscientious, practical, realistic, and dependable. While the ESTJ will dutifully do everything that is important to work towards a particular cause or goal, they might not naturally see or value the importance &nbsp;&nbsp;of goals which are outside of their practical scope. However, if the ESTJ is able to see the relevance of such goals to practical concerns, you can bet that they&#8217;ll put every effort into understanding them and incorporating them into their quest for clarity and security.

  * Natural leaders &#8211; they like to be in charge

&nbsp;

ESTJ’s have a lot of flexibility in the types of careers that they choose. They are good at a lot of different things, because they put forth a tremendous amount of effort towards doing things the right way. They will be happiest in leadership positions, however, because they have a natural drive to be in charge. They are best suited for jobs which require creating order and structure.

<u>ESTJ Relationships</u>

ESTJ’s are very enthusiastic people who are driven to fulfill their obligations and duties, especially those towards their families. Their priorities generally put God first, family second, and friends third. They put forth a tremendous amount of effort to meet their obligations and duties, according to their priorities. They are dedicated and committed to their relationships, which they consider to be lifelong and unalterable. They like to be in charge, and may be very controlling of their mates and children. They have high esteem for traditions and institutions, and expect that their mates and children will support these as well. They have little patience and need for dealing with people who see things very differently from the ESTJ.
