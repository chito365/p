        <strong>Formation and Tactical Structure</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://outsideoftheboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48723" src="http://outsideoftheboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" srcset="http://outsideoftheboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002.jpg 516w, http://outsideoftheboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image002-300x210.jpg 300w" alt="" width="516" height="362" /></a>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As seen in the image above, Howe uses an established formation but has modernised it to suit his playing style and his squad at his disposal over the years he has been in the dugout at Bournemouth. He diverges away from the traditional 4-4-2 into a 4-4-1-1 for the Cherries. Different formations have been tried and tested with but this suits Howe’s philosophy best as they are able to move the ball from defence to attack, but this is through patient build up play and not the stereotypical lower English side desperately launching long balls to a target man. The whole team works together in great cohesion, reflective of their team-spirit to battle and overcome opponents whilst adhering to Howe’s ideologies.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://outsideoftheboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image004.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48724" src="http://outsideoftheboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image004.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" srcset="http://outsideoftheboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image004.jpg 524w, http://outsideoftheboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image004-300x209.jpg 300w" alt="" width="524" height="365" /></a>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When the game is in motion, the formation alters slightly with positions and movements of the players, which have been shown with circles and arrows. The fullbacks push up high to support the attack, either by overlapping the winger or coming inside to give an extra passing option. Andrew Surman tends to drop the deeper of the two central midfielders being the main man in shielding the defense and picking up the loose balls, leaving Harry Arter to play the box-to-box role. The wingers push high and wide to take their opponents into one-on-ones, isolating them and the extra support of the fullback often overloads the opponents near to their goal. The second striker; Joshua King, tends to roam in the space circled in between the midfield and attack, causing chaos for the opposition who struggle to keep an eye on the Norwegian forward.

      <pre>Any thoughts about other ones? I've got my thoughts, but I'm not really sure of them, so I think I'll wait for other theories about further managers (and players). You may leave a comment Below, Suggesting your best matching MBTI Personality. Thank you.
