  User centered design
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  What is User-Centered Design?
</div>

<div>
  • An approach to UI development and system&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  development.
</div>

<div>
  • Focuses on understanding:
</div>

<div>
  –Users, and –Users, and
</div>

<div>
  –Their goals and tasks, and
</div>

<div>
  –The environment (physical, organizational, social)
</div>

<div>
  • Pay attention to these throughout&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  development
</div>

<div>
  ISO on User-centered Design
</div>

<div>
  • ISO 13407 describes human-centered design&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  processes for interactive systems
</div>

<div>
  • Principles of human-centered design:
</div>

<div>
  –Active involvement of users –Active involvement of users
</div>

<div>
  –Appropriate allocation of function between user&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  and system
</div>

<div>
  –Iteration of design solutions
</div>

<div>
  –Multidisciplinary design teams
</div>

<div>
  ISO on User-centered Design (2)
</div>

<div>
  • Essential activities in human-centered design:
</div>

<div>
  –Understand and specify the context of use
</div>

<div>
  –Specify the user and organizational requirements
</div>

<div>
  –Produce design solutions (prototypes) –Produce design solutions (prototypes)
</div>

<div>
  –Evaluate designs with users against requirements
</div>

<div>
  What is a user-centeredapproach?
</div>

<div>
  User-centered approach is based on:
</div>

<div>
  – Early focus on users and tasks: directly studying cognitive, behavioral,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  anthropomorphic & attitudinal characteristics
</div>

<div>
  – Empirical measurement:users’ reactions and performance to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  scenarios, manuals, simulations & prototypes are observed, recorded&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  and analysed
</div>

<div>
  – Iterative design: when problems are found in user testing, fix them&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  and carry out more tests
</div>

<div>
  Four basic activities
</div>

<div>
  There are four basic activities in Interaction Design:
</div>

<div>
  – 1. Identifying needs and establishing requirements
</div>

<div>
  – 2. Developing alternative designs
</div>

<div>
  – 3. Building interactive versions of the designs
</div>

<div>
  – 4. Evaluating designs
</div>

<div>
  A simple interaction design model
</div>

<div>
  Exemplifies a user-centered design approach
</div>

<div>
  Some practical issues
</div>

<div>
  • Who are the users?
</div>

<div>
  • What are ‘needs’?
</div>

<div>
  Target users
</div>

<div>
  Who are the users/stakeholders?
</div>

<div>
  • Not as obvious as you think:
</div>

<div>
  – those who interact directly with the product
</div>

<div>
  – those who manage direct users
</div>

<div>
  – those who receive output from the product&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  – those who make the purchasing decision&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  – those who use competitor’s products – those who use competitor’s products
</div>

<div>
  • Three categories of user (Eason, 1987):&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  – primary: frequent hands-on
</div>

<div>
  – secondary: occasional or via someone else
</div>

<div>
  – tertiary: affected by its introduction, or will influence its purchase
</div>

<div>
  What are the users’ capabilities?&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  Individual differences:&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  —size of hands may affect the size and positioning of input&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  buttons&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  —motor abilities may affect the suitability of certain input&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  and output devices&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  —height if designing a physical kiosk &nbsp;—height if designing a physical kiosk&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  —strength -a child’s toy requires little strength to operate,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  but greater strength to change batteries
</div>

<div>
  —disabilities (e.g. sight, hearing, dexterity)
</div>

<div>
  —abilities also vary according to context
</div>

<div>
  Users’needs
</div>

<div>
  What are ‘needs’?
</div>

<div>
  • Users rarely know what is possible
</div>

<div>
  • Users can’t tell you what they ‘need’ to help them achieve their&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  goals&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Instead, look at existing tasks:
</div>

<div>
  –their context
</div>

<div>
  –what information do they require? –what information do they require?
</div>

<div>
  –who collaborates to achieve the task?
</div>

<div>
  –why is the task achieved the way it is?
</div>

<div>
  • Envisioned tasks:
</div>

<div>
  –can be rooted in existing behaviour
</div>

<div>
  –can be described as future scenarios
</div>

<div>
  Brief overview of common methods&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  to gather user data
</div>

<div>
   Interviews
</div>

<div>
   Questionnaires
</div>

<div>
   Observation  Observation
</div>

<div>
   Choosing and combining techniques
</div>

<div>
  Interviews
</div>

<div>
  • Unstructured -are not directed by a script. Rich but not&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  replicable.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Structured -are tightly scripted, a questionnaire delivered&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  verbally. Replicable but may lack richness.
</div>

<div>
  • Semi-structured -guided by a script but interesting issues can &nbsp;• Semi-structured -guided by a script but interesting issues can&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  be explored in more depth. Can provide a good balance&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  between richness and replicability.
</div>

<div>
  Interview questions
</div>

<div>
  • Two types:
</div>

<div>
  −‘closed questions’have a predetermined answer&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  format, e.g., ‘yes’or ‘no’
</div>

<div>
  −‘open questions’do not have a predetermined format
</div>

<div>
  • Closed questions are easier to analyze
</div>

<div>
   Avoid:
</div>

<div>
  −Long questions −Long questions
</div>

<div>
  −Compound sentences -split them into two
</div>

<div>
  −Jargon and language that the interviewee may not&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  understand&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  −Leading questions that make assumptions e.g., why do&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  you like …?
</div>

<div>
  −Unconscious biases e.g., gender stereotypes
</div>

<div>
  Enriching the interview process
</div>

<div>
  • Props -devices for prompting interviewee, e.g., a prototype,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  scenario
</div>

<div>
  Contextual Inquiry
</div>

<div>
  • An approach to ethnographic study. Often conducted as an&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  apprenticeship where user is expert, designer is apprentice
</div>

<div>
  • A form of interview, but
</div>

<div>
  —at users’workplace (workstation)
</div>

<div>
  —2 to 3 hours long
</div>

<div>
  • Four main principles: • Four main principles:
</div>

<div>
  —Context: see workplace & what happens
</div>

<div>
  —Partnership: user and developer collaborate
</div>

<div>
  —Interpretation: observations interpreted by user and developer&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  together
</div>

<div>
  —Focus: project focus to understand what to look for
</div>

<div>
  Questionnaires
</div>

<div>
  • Questions can be closed or open
</div>

<div>
  • Closed questions are easier to analyze, and may be done by&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  computer
</div>

<div>
  • Can be administered to large populations
</div>

<div>
  • Paper, email and the web used for dissemination
</div>

<div>
  • Sampling can be a problem when the size of a population is&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  unknown as is common online
</div>

<div>
  Questionnaire design
</div>

<div>
  • The impact of a question can be influenced by question order.
</div>

<div>
  • Do you need different versions of the questionnaire for different&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  populations?
</div>

<div>
  • Provide clear instructions on how to complete the questionnaire.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Strike a balance between using white space and keeping the&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  questionnaire compact.
</div>

<div>
  • Decide on whether phrases will all be positive, all negative or &nbsp;• Decide on whether phrases will all be positive, all negative or&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  mixed.
</div>

<div>
  Advantages of online questionnaires
</div>

<div>
   Responses are usually received quickly
</div>

<div>
   No copying and postage costs
</div>

<div>
   Data can be collected in database for analysis
</div>

<div>
   Time required for data analysis is reduced  Time required for data analysis is reduced
</div>

<div>
   Errors can be corrected easily
</div>

<div>
  Problems with online questionnaires
</div>

<div>
   Sampling is problematic if population size is unknown
</div>

<div>
   Preventing individuals from responding more than once
</div>

<div>
   Individuals have also been known to change questions in&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  email questionnaires
</div>

<div>
  Observation
</div>

<div>
  • Direct observation in the field
</div>

<div>
  – Structuring frameworks
</div>

<div>
  – Degree of participation (insider or outsider)
</div>

<div>
  – Ethnography
</div>

<div>
  • Direct observation in controlled environments • Direct observation in controlled environments
</div>

<div>
  • Indirect observation: tracking users’activities

<div>
  Ethnography (1)
</div>

<div>
   Ethnography is a philosophy with a set of techniques that&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  include participant observation and interviews
</div>

<div>
   Debate about differences between participant observation&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  and ethnography
</div>

<div>
   Ethnographers immerse themselves in the culture that they&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  study
</div>

<div>
   A researchers degree of participation can vary along a scale &nbsp; A researcher’s degree of participation can vary along a scale&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  from ‘outside’to ‘inside’
</div>

<div>
   Analyzing video and data logs can be time-consuming
</div>

<div>
   Collections of comments, incidents, and artifacts are made&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  Ethnography (2)
</div>

<div>
  • Co-operation of people being observed is required
</div>

<div>
  • Informants are useful
</div>

<div>
  • Data analysis is continuous
</div>

<div>
  • Interpretivist technique
</div>

<div>
  • Questions get refined as understanding grows
</div>

<div>
  • Reports usually contain examples
