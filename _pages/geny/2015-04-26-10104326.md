A software process model is an abstract representation of a process. It presents a description of a process. &nbsp;  
When we describe and discuss processes, we usually talk about the activities in these processes such as specifying a data model, designing a user interface, etc. and the ordering of these activities.  
Process descriptions may also include:  
Products, which are the outcomes of a process activity;  
Roles, which reflect the responsibilities of the people involved in the process;  
Pre- and post-conditions, which are statements that are true before and after a process activity has been enacted or a product produced.&nbsp; &nbsp;  
Notation: activities, products
