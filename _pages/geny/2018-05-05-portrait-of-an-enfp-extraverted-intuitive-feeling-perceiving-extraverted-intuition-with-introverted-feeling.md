**_The_** **_Inspirer_**

**_&nbsp;_**

As an ENFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system.

&nbsp;

ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential. They live in the world of possibilities, and can become very passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm lends them the ability to inspire and motivate others, more so than we see in other types. They can talk their way in or out of anything. They love life, seeing it as a special gift, and strive to make the most out of it.

&nbsp;

ENFPs have an unusually broad range of skills and talents. They are good at most things which interest them. Project-oriented, they may go through several different careers during their lifetime. To onlookers, &nbsp;&nbsp;the ENFP may seem directionless and without purpose, but ENFPs are actually quite consistent, in that they have a strong sense of values which they live with throughout their lives. Everything that they do must be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in line with their values. An ENFP needs to feel that they are living their lives as their true Self, walking in step with what they believe is right. They see meaning in everything, and are on a continuous quest to adapt their lives and values to achieve inner peace. They&#8217;re constantly aware and somewhat fearful of losing &nbsp;&nbsp;touch with themselves. Since emotional excitement is usually an important part of the ENFP&#8217;s life, and because they are focused on keeping &#8220;centered&#8221;, the ENFP is usually an intense individual, with highly evolved values.

&nbsp;

An ENFP needs to focus on following through with their projects. This can be a problem area for some of these individuals. Unlike other Extraverted types, ENFPs need time alone to center themselves, and make sure they are moving in a direction which is in sync with their values. ENFPs who remain centered will usually be quite successful at their endeavors. Others may fall into the habit of dropping a project when &nbsp;they become excited about a new possibility, and thus they never achieve the great accomplishments which they are capable of achieving.

&nbsp;

Most ENFPs have great people skills. They are genuinely warm and interested in people, and place great importance on their inter-personal relationships. ENFPs almost always have a strong need to be liked.

Sometimes, especially at a younger age, an ENFP will tend to be &#8220;gushy&#8221; and insincere, and generally &#8220;overdo&#8221; in an effort to win acceptance. However, once an ENFP has learned to balance their need to be true to themselves with their need for acceptance, they excel at bringing out the best in others, and are typically well-liked. They have an exceptional ability to intuitively understand a person after a very short period of time, and use their intuition and flexibility to relate to others on their own level.

&nbsp;

Because ENFPs live in the world of exciting possibilities, the details of everyday life are seen as trivial drudgery. They place no importance on detailed, maintenance-type tasks, and will frequently remain oblivious to these types of concerns. When they do have to perform these tasks, they do not enjoy themselves. This is a challenging area of life for most ENFPs, and can be frustrating for ENFP&#8217;s family members.

&nbsp;

An ENFP who has &#8220;gone wrong&#8221; may be quite manipulative &#8211; and very good it. The gift of gab which they are blessed with makes it naturally easy for them to get what they want. Most ENFPs will not abuse their abilities, because that would not jive with their value systems.

&nbsp;

ENFPs sometimes make serious errors in judgment. They have an amazing ability to intuitively perceive the truth about a person or situation, but when they apply judgment to their perception, they may jump to the wrong conclusions.

&nbsp;

ENFPs who have not learned to follow through may have a difficult time remaining happy in marital relationships. Always seeing the possibilities of what could be, they may become bored with what actually is. The strong sense of values will keep many ENFPs dedicated to their relationships. However, ENFPs like a little excitement in their lives, and are best matched with individuals who are comfortable with change &nbsp;&nbsp;and new experiences.

&nbsp;

Having an ENFP parent can be a fun-filled experience, but may be stressful at times for children with &nbsp;&nbsp;strong Sensing or Judging tendencies. Such children may see the ENFP parent as inconsistent and difficult &nbsp;to understand, as the children are pulled along in the whirlwind life of the ENFP. Sometimes the ENFP will want to be their child&#8217;s best friend, and at other times they will play the parental authoritarian. But ENFPs are always consistent in their value systems, which they will impress on their children above all else, along with a basic joy of living.

&nbsp;

ENFPs are basically happy people. They may become unhappy when they are confined to strict schedules &nbsp;or mundane tasks. Consequently, ENFPs work best in situations where they have a lot of flexibility, and where they can work with people and ideas. Many go into business for themselves. They have the ability to be quite productive with little supervision, as long as they are excited about what they&#8217;re doing.

Because they are so alert and sensitive, constantly scanning their environments, ENFPs often suffer from muscle tension. They have a strong need to be independent, and resist being controlled or labeled. They need to maintain control over themselves, but they do not believe in controlling others. Their dislike of dependence and suppression extends to others as well as to themselves.

&nbsp;

ENFPs are charming, ingenuous, risk-taking, sensitive, people-oriented individuals with capabilities ranging across a broad spectrum. They have many gifts which they will use to fulfill themselves and those near them, if they are able to remain centered and master the ability of following through.

<u>What does Success mean to an ENFP?</u>

ENFPs are motivated in everything that they do by a desire to understand the world around them. They are constantly searching about. Mentally and physically, for input that will help them to better understand the Big Picture. They are open-minded to new people and new experiences; they’re eager for the opportunity &nbsp;to understand what the new people and experiences are all about. &nbsp;ENFPs use their understanding of the world to serve the agendas of their value systems. &nbsp;An ENFP’s value system often includes respect for the needs and desires of individual people over the needs of a social group. Their respect for the individual makes them dislike controlling others, and being controlled by others. &nbsp;ENFPs are passionate about their beliefs, whatever they may be. &nbsp;They often stubbornly adhere to their value system regardless of threats to its validity. &nbsp;They are more concerned with keeping true to what they believe than they are with &nbsp;expectations or demands from the social group that they function within. ENFPs dislike personal criticism, because it threatens their validity as an individual and the validity of their value system. &nbsp;ENFPs may internalize anger rather than express it; their respect for other individuals makes it difficult for them to hurt others. &nbsp;An ENFP’s feeling of success depends upon the availability of opportunities to grow their understanding of the world, upon feeling that they’re living true to their personal value system, and upon &nbsp;the condition of their closest relationships.
