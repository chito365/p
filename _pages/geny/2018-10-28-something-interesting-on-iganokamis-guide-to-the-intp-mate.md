I found this list on a couple of INTP forums and thought it was something interesting. I personally found it to be mostly true. Even, embarrassingly, #6. The way I express love is ridiculous. It would seem that the only people who are compatible with us INTPs are those that find quirky hermits endearing. ðŸ˜›

**1.Â Lots of sex:Â **I dont think it isÂ just me as an INTP who finds this a very important part of a relationship and the most important physical expression of love in a relationship &#8211; it is NOT a selfish act for selfish physical satisfaction. but hell, it is damn pleasing, too.

**2.Â Moral support:Â **It is a tough world out there for INTPs.

**3.Â An equal:**Â INTPs have no wish to dominate, and are crushed by domination.

4.Â **Someone who is next to unoffendable:**Â INTPs tend to lack tact, but also want and need to be brutally honest with thier intimate partners &#8211; they want someone who they can playfully insult, who will then either laugh in thier face or give it right back.

**5.Â Someone who can accept them for who they are and not try to change them:**Â INTPs appear erratic to the casual observer in a relationship, for example &#8211; they appear to demand solitude one moment, sex the next. Non-INTPs find this VERY hard to reconcile with their typical conception of &#8220;love&#8221;.

**6.Â Someone who accepts the peculiar WAYS they show their love:**Â Be it really, really sappy hopeless-romantic type drivel or passionate physical expression, or just a touch or a simple look. The INTP way is very hard to catch, if you blink, you miss it. Non-INTPs tend to want tokens and words, not a slow dance in a room with no radio, not a quiet cuddle in front of the TV at the end of the day, or the other strange and random expressions that INTPs tend to give. [This ties in with #5.]

**7.Â SPACEÂ **[as in both physical and emotional space] In case it was missed, I&#8217;ll mention it again: SPACE!! INTP men and women need their free time to pursue intellectual pursuits, and CAN NOT be: a) disturbed. b) told they dont love thier partner because they spend too much time &#8220;alone&#8221;, etc. INTPs disappear for a while, then come out swinging. This FORCES most non-INTPs to think that the INTP partner only wants them for sex. This is wrong, but if the non-INTP is not capable of #5 and #6, they are forced to believe it.

**8.Â Comforting**. [this goes along with #2.]The world sucks, particularly for INTPs. They are capable of an utterly staggering amount of patience and responsibility, but in the long run, without #2 and #8, the relationship will ultimately die, or the INTP will DIE a very real death. With #2 and #8, an INTP can take a spectacular amount of abuse, responsibility, and patience in life, as long as his partner supplies #2 and #8 in sufficient quantities.

**9.Â An intellect**: A person who can hold their own in a debate. The words &#8220;you always think you are right!!&#8221; are the LAST words an INTP wants to hear from their mate. The INTP wants debate! Wants intellectual stimulation! If they doesn&#8217;t get it at home, #7 becomes very very very important. If their mate can not handle #7, there will be PROBLEMS. If the mate can supply #9, the INTP will be very happily occupied with their mate for a long, long time.

**10.Â Someone to learn with**: [This goes with #9] Someone who is interested in learning and intellectual stimulation. The INTP needs someone who they can learn with and enjoy the mysteries and adventures of life with. Someone who can understand their interest in the esoteric, show appreciation for their interests, and even join them in these interests, or introduce them to new ones.

**11.Â Someone capable of self reflection and self analysis**: Often the INTP finds that they are the only one &#8220;growing&#8221; in a relationship, the only one who can see the problems in the relationship. This usually forces the INTP to be the one to change, to be the one to compromise for their partner. Because many non-INTPs have no true ability to self reflect the non-INTP thinks they are ALWAYS right. The INTP spends their life examining themselves and their relationship to see what they need to do to make it work. So they spend all their time critically analyzing it, and the mate does nothing but demand that they change. This will eventually lead to the spiritual DEATH of the INTP, if not the actual PHYSICAL death of the INTP. To avoid this, the INTP person NEEDS a mate who can examine the relationship WITH them, so they can grow TOGETHER.
