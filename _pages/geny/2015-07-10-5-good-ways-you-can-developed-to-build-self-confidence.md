1.Believe In Yourself Believing in yourself is the first step in building your confidence. Many times we waver in our thinking when we make a decision. We ask ourselves over and over, “Am I sure I can do this? OrIs this the right answer?” Have faith that you are doing the right thing and watch your confidence grow in knowing that you are fully prepared and ready for your greatness!

2.Stay away from negative individuals When working on building confidence another key is to stay focused and stay away from those negative individuals in your life. Please don’t be surprised that I said this, because you are not the only person who has negativity around them. We all do. One important lesson that I’ve learned is that just because it’s around you, doesn’t mean it has to be a part of you. Negative words and actions make us rethink who we are and what we want.

3.Meditate Meditating on how you can better yourself is always good. Concentrating on what would make you better is where you should start. Being quiet and focusing on the certainty that you have the answers that will make you a strong confident person can do wonders for your well-being. Practice this daily or at least three to four times a week.

4.Speak your truth Being honest with yourself about who you are and what you want is refreshing and can help you to exhale which can also help with you self-confidence. When you are able to stand up straight with your head high, it shows that you are comfortable with who you are. It is also contagious for those around you. When people see you and feel your confidence all around them, they too will feel reassured in themselves.

5.Be ready When I say, “Be Ready” it means to be prepared for what happens when you start to trust who you are and when others see the change in you. Building confidence doesn’t mean that you are changing into a new person, but it does mean that your thoughts are changing. Your thoughts are the thoughts of a person who is sure of themselves and will stay the path of a positive person in whatever goal they set.
