  - THE SECRET LAW OF ATTRACTION
---
The fact that the _Law of Attraction_ remains constant and stable throughout the Universe was a big factor in your confdence as you came into your new physical environment, for you knew that the feedback of life would help you to remember and gain your footing. You remembered that the basis of everything is _vibration_ and that the _Law of Attraction_ responds to those vibrations and, in essence, organizes them, bringing things of like vibrations together while holding those not of like vibrations apart.

&nbsp;

And so, you were not concerned about not being able to articulate that knowledge right away or to explain it to those around you who had seemingly forgotten everything they knew about it, because you knew that the consistency of this powerful _Law_ would, soon enough, show itself to you through the examples of your own life. You knew then that it would not be diffcult to fgure out what kinds of vibrations you were offering because the _Law of Attraction_ would be bringing to you constant evidence of whatever your vibration was.

&nbsp;

In other words, when you feel _overwhelmed,_ circumstances and people who could help you get out from under your feeling of overwhelment cannot fnd you, nor can you fnd them. Even when you try hard to fnd them, you cannot. And those people who _do_ come do not help you, but, instead, they add to your feeling of overwhelment.

&nbsp;

When you feel _mistreated_—fairness cannot fnd you. Your perception of your mistreatment, and the subsequent vibration that you offer because of your perception, prevents anything that you would consider to be fair from coming to you.

&nbsp;

When you are buried in the _disappointment_ or _fear_ of not having the fnancial resources that you believe you need, the dollars—or the opportunities that would bring the dollars—continue to elude you . . . not because you are bad or unworthy, but because the _Law of Attraction_ matches things that are like, not things that are _un_like.

&nbsp;

When you feel _poor_—only things that feel like _poverty_ can come to you. When you feel _prosperous_—only things that feel like _prosperity_ can come to you. This _Law_ is consistent; and if you will pay attention, it will teach you, through life experience, how it works. _When you remember that you get the essence of what you think about—and then you notice what you are getting—you have the keys for Deliberate Creation._
