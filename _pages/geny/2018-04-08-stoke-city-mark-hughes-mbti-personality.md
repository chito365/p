### Manager Bio {.subHeader}

**Mark Hughes has taken charge of six clubs in the Premier League, and played for five.**

The former forward is capped 72 times for Wales&nbsp;and is a two-time Premier League title winner with Manchester United. Hughes has also represented Chelsea, Southampton, Everton and Blackburn Rovers as a player in England&#8217;s top flight.

Hughes started his managerial career on a part-time basis with Wales and took on his first domestic job in 2004 with former club Blackburn.

He led Rovers&nbsp;to three top-ten finishes in the Premier League on the spin before taking charge of Manchester City in 2008.

The Citizens&nbsp;finished eighth in the 2008/09 campaign before the Welshman departed Manchester&nbsp;in December 2009.

In the 2010/11 campaign, he took charge of Fulham and led them to eighth place in the table, qualifying for the UEFA Europa League as a result.

Following his resignation from Craven Cottage in the summer of 2011, Hughes was appointed as manager of Queens Park Rangers in January 2012.

He successfully guided the club to Premier League safety in the 2011/12 campaign but left&nbsp;in November 2012, taking a short absence from football.

Hughes was appointed as Tony Pulis&#8217; replacement at Stoke ahead of the 2013/14 campaign, guiding the Potters to ninth place in his first three seasons in charge.

A 13th-place finish followed in 2016/17, but Hughes departed Stoke on 6 January, 2018, after more than four years at the club.

He secured a swift return to the Premier League when Southampton named him manager on 14 March, 2018, signing a contract to the end of the season.</section>

MBTI Personality: INFJ</strong>

Any thoughts about other ones? I've got my thoughts, but I'm not really sure of them, so I think I'll wait for other theories about further managers (and players).
