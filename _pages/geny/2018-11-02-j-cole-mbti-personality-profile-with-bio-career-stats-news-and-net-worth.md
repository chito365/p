                  Cole was brought up in a multi-ethnic environment and says that his upbringing makes him totally against racism. Cole was a shy kid and was immensely attracted to music and basketball. He played violin for some time and this was the time when he got addicted to music and started dreaming about being a musician someday.

                  Rapping came natural to Cole and he started doing it quite often by the time he was 12. Upon receiving a music sampler one Christmas from his mother, Cole became hooked to music production. He joined a few local small time groups and started practicing rapping and making beats.

              Cole thought that a move to New York would let his musical ambitions breathe and he found the right excuse by expressing the desire to study there and majored in computer science, and kept working on his music side by side.

                    J. Cole&#8217;s career started at a very young age when he and cousin started to learn the basic tricks and nuances of music production on their own. They wrote lyrics together and upon receiving a drum machine from his mother, Cole started refining his music production skills, and by the time he turned 16, he was sending out his mixtapes to some of the best known names in the business such as Jay Z and Eminem, but to no avail.

                    Cole had already released his first mixtape ‘The come up’ in the hope of getting noticed but got disappointment instead. He would stand outside Jay Z’s office for hours and when he finally got a call from the man himself, he knew his time had come. Jay Z was initially not impressed with Cole, but understood his passion and gave him a chance to feature in one of the songs for his album ‘The Blueprint 3’, which received critical acclaim and thereafter, Cole started collaborating with more artists and released his second mixtape in June 2009.

                    It was now the time for his first studio album ‘Cole Story: The Other Side’ in 2011 and it immediately climbed to the top spot in the Billboard 200 chart in the very first week of its release.

                    The very next year, Cole made a comeback with yet another solid album titled ‘2014 Forest Hills Drive’. According to him, it was a little bit autobiographical. Despite being not promoted well enough and announced just a couple of weeks before its release, the album became a massive hit as soon as it hit the markets and debuted at number 1 spot in most of the charts. One single from the album titled ‘Apparently’ was nominated for the Grammy awards in the Best Rap Performance segment and the album also ended up grabbing a nomination for the Best Rap Album award.
