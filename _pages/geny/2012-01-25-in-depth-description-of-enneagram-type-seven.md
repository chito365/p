**Common Descriptive Names:** (1) The Epicure, (2) The Enthusiast, (3) The Entertainer



**Unconscious Fear for type Seven:** Of being deprived or limited or stuck in pain  
To compensate for their Unconscious Fear an Unconscious Desire arises&#8230;..  
Unconscious Desire for type Seven: To be satisfied, fulfilled and happy

As our personality was forming in early childhood we each developed limiting subconscious beliefs  
about ourselves, others and the world. For example, your mother or father might have yelled at you  
“Get your hands out of there!” or “You should be ashamed of yourself!” or “Stop being such a cry  
baby!” If you had really loving parents you might have heard, “Don’t touch that, it’s hot!” or “Don’t do  
that, you might hurt yourself!” We also developed limiting beliefs about others. Growing up you may  
have heard, “I don’t want you to play with those kinds of kids” or “Salesmen are sleazebags” or  
“Politicians are so duplicitous and two-faced.” We also developed limiting beliefs about the world.  
Newspapers and television constantly bombard our minds with reports of scandals, crimes, wars,  
economic crises, natural disasters, and political corruption. Does this help us believe the world is a  
loving, safe place to live? Of course not. One way or another, none of us escaped childhood without  
some limiting subconscious beliefs. Your Enneagram type identifies some of the strongest  
subconscious beliefs that you’ve developed over time based on your distorted perception of reality.

**Limiting Subconscious Beliefs for type Seven:**  
• I require numerous enjoyable outside experiences to feel fulfilled.  
• Something better (more exciting, more fun) has to be just around the corner; I just  
need to keep looking.  
• To be loved I must keep myself positive and life “up.”

**Core Coping Strategies for Sevens:** (where Sevens focus their attention because of their  
subconscious beliefs)  
• Heightened imagination and positive, anticipatory thinking  
• Keeping life upbeat, exciting and enjoyable  
• Putting a positive reframe on negative experiences  
• Moving on to something better when stuck in pain  
• Focusing on the bright side, even in difficult situations  
• Resilience – bouncing back quickly after painful incidents  
• Planning ability (for pleasurable, positive experiences)  
• Imagining and engaging in interesting activities  
• Explaining and justifying own inappropriate behavior (rationalizing)  
• Avoiding negative feelings that bring life down

**Here’s a brief profile of some healthy, very healthy, average, unhealthy and destructive type**  
**Seven traits.**  
**Healthy Sevens** are optimistic, enthusiastic, idealistic and excitable. They view life as an actionpacked,  
fun-filled adventure yet they also want to contribute to others because of their idealism. They  
are outgoing and curious and find life to be exhilarating, invigorating and an endless source of  
fascination. Healthy Sevens are spontaneous, upbeat and highly responsive to their environment.  
They have quick, agile minds and vast amounts of energy for work and play. Healthy Sevens are so  
enjoyable to be around because they’re infectiously high-spirited and vivacious. They are also  
generous and want to share their joy, gratitude and appreciation of life with others. They are sociable  
and like going places and doing active things with people. Healthy Sevens can be extremely playful,  
entertaining and quick-witted. They smile and laugh a lot, enjoy telling stories and are eager to share  
a joke or two with everyone they meet. Healthy Sevens are free-spirited and often lift the spirits of  
more serious or melancholy types.  
But healthy Sevens aren’t just about fun and games. They are highly practical and prolific achievers  
too. They tend to be multitalented and often become accomplished in many areas. They are versatile  
and resourceful generalists who are often highly creative and productive, able to cross-fertilize their  
interests, skills and talents from many diverse areas. They are able to visualize the future they want  
to create and plan accordingly. They then organize and execute their life according to their values and  
priorities to manifest their desired future.  
Healthy Sevens take disappointments and setbacks in stride. Very little keeps them down for long  
because they believe people are meant to be happy and life is meant to be fun. So, they bounce back  
from heartaches and disappointments, even calamities, with amazing resilience and often renewed zest  
for life.

Very healthy Sevens, like Benjamin Franklin*, are grounded in the present moment and appreciative  
of whatever life presents them because they know it is all good. No longer scattered by a hyperactive  
mind, very healthy Sevens are able to allow their experiences to touch them deeply. They savor every  
moment fully rather than anticipating future moments in the mind and missing out on this moment.  
They contribute their time and energy to worthwhile causes because they want everyone to share in the delight, wonderment and magic of life. They have an ecstatic sense of being swept along by life  
and feel confident that they will always have enough of what they need to be content and joyous.  
* My speculation based on his life and my experience with the Enneagram

**Average Sevens** fear missing out on fun experiences so they try to do more and stay busy. They  
insist on being free, keeping their options open, and are constantly making plans for new, exciting  
future adventures. Average Sevens are seekers of continuous excitement and stimulation and find the  
everyday drudgeries of life dull (like Fours). They have a hard time putting limits on themselves,  
denying themselves or being bored for a moment. They tend to be undisciplined, hyperactive and  
acquisitive (hoping that “things” will bring them satisfaction). As they become more restless, average  
Sevens fear missing out on pleasures and experiences so they become indiscriminate, scattering their  
energy, talents and resources in every direction with no particular focus. They lose their sense of  
priorities and never stay with one thing long enough to really develop it. They can be superficial  
dabblers who are way overextended, trying to do too many things at once and doing none of them  
very well (work-wise) or fully enjoying any of them in the moment (play-wise). They are trying to find  
the experiences that they believe will satisfy them but never quite seem to find them or get enough to  
feel fulfilled and content. Rather than seeing this unfulfilling pattern in themselves and changing their  
behavior, average Sevens try to experience an ever wider range of experiences that they believe will  
surely satisfy them. But the more they seek stimulation outside themselves the more out of control  
and anxious they become inside. It can create a vicious cycle of ever increasing impulsive activity and  
ever increasing anxiety. Their flight from boredom is really a flight from unconscious pain and fear.  
Average Sevens are outspoken. They have a tendency to say whatever comes to mind because they  
are more or less uninhibited. They enjoy making wisecracks and playing practical jokes. They also  
enjoy telling stories and often exaggerate for effect.  
Average Sevens can be non-committal. They crave variety and excitement and fear being deprived of  
anything they want or being constrained in any way. So, commitments seem confining rather than  
appealing to average Sevens. Most people find Sevens amusing and entertaining but their  
indefatigable and restless energy can be exhausting for someone who’s in a relationship with an  
average Seven. Sevens want their partner to do things with them so unless their partner is willing and  
able to keep up with them, average Sevens will get bored with their partner and get itchy feet to move  
on to someone new and exciting. It was probably a Seven who coined the phrase, “the grass is always  
greener on the other side of the fence.” Average Sevens have difficulty dealing with other people’s  
negative or painful emotions because they don’t like dealing with their own.

**Unhealthy Sevens** live more and more excessively and extravagantly to escape their growing  
anxieties and fear of deprivation. They are capricious and hedonistic, narcissistic and crude. They  
have repressed emotional problems that lead them to indulge their every appetite and yet never feel  
satisfied. Increasingly frustrated and dissatisfied, unhealthy Sevens can become rude, self-centered,  
thoughtless, demanding, impatient and insensitive to others. If they have addictive tendencies they  
will fully come out at this level. Reckless spending is common. Unhealthy Sevens can unintentionally  
cause others a lot of pain with their irresponsible and erratic behavior but they will rationalize their  
behavior and deny guilt or responsibility for causing any problems.  
Destructive Sevens attempt to escape anxiety by any means possible. They are extremely  
impulsive, manic, infantile, compulsive and out of control. Their need for instant gratification has lead  
them to serious addiction problems. They have no tolerance or capacity to deal with any kind of  
unpleasantness or suffering. Drug and alcohol abuse, sexual addiction and gambling are all common.  
Sevens at this level can’t sustain their manic lifestyle for long, however, and so “crash” into extremely  
erratic mood swings and debilitating depressions as well as frequent panic attacks and episodes of  
paralyzing terror. They usually have severe health problems. Because of their excessive lifestyle,  
unhealthy Sevens can bring about the very thing they were trying to avoid, being stuck in pain (their  
unconscious fear).
