Common Descriptive Names: (1) The Achiever, (2) The Performer, (3) The Motivator  
Unconscious Fear for type Three: Of being worthless (apart from their achievements)  
To compensate for their Unconscious Fear an Unconscious Desire arises&#8230;..  
Unconscious Desire for type Three: To be valuable and desirable (as measured by the favorable  
responses they receive from others)

As our personality was forming in early childhood we each developed limiting subconscious beliefs  
about ourselves, others and the world. For example, your mother or father might have yelled at you  
“Get your hands out of there!” or “You should be ashamed of yourself!” or “Stop being such a cry  
baby!” If you had really loving parents you might have heard, “Don’t touch that, it’s hot!” or “Don’t do  
that, you might hurt yourself!” We also developed limiting beliefs about others. Growing up you may  
have heard, “I don’t want you to play with those kinds of kids” or “Salesmen are sleazebags” or  
“Politicians are so duplicitous and two-faced.” We also developed limiting beliefs about the world.  
Newspapers and television constantly bombard our minds with reports of scandals, crimes, wars,  
economic crises, natural disasters, and political corruption. Does this help us believe the world is a  
loving, safe place to live? Of course not. One way or another, none of us escaped childhood without  
some limiting subconscious beliefs. Your Enneagram type identifies some of the strongest  
subconscious beliefs that you’ve developed over time based on your distorted perception of reality.

**Limiting Subconscious Beliefs for type Three:**

• My worth depends on my achievements.  
• True feelings are not to be expressed if they make you look bad.  
• My value is dependent on the positive regard of others.  
• It’s important to present a winning image.  
• It’s up to me to “make it” in life.  
• To be loved I must be successful, a winner.

Core Coping Strategies for Threes:

: (where Threes focus their attention because of their  
subconscious beliefs)  
• Intense focus on tasks, goals, achievement, and success  
• Manage time for maximum efficiency and productivity  
• Work exceptionally hard and compete to be the best  
• Can be extremely focused and work diligently  
• Know how to present something in a compelling and acceptable way  
• Repress feelings for maximum performance and results  
• Present a winning personality that people will admire  
• Meet challenges by being extremely adaptable. Threes adjust their behavior and affect  
to meet expectations and succeed

**Here’s a brief profile of some healthy, very healthy, average, unhealthy and destructive type**  
**Three traits.**

**Healthy Threes** are highly productive, naturally self-confident, optimistic and unpretentiously selfassured.  
They have an attractive, winning personality. They’re energetic, enthusiastic, diplomatic and  
often very charismatic and popular. They are tremendously hard-working but they’re also extremely  
effective at time management and delegating responsibility so they get more done in a day than most  
people do in two or three days. If Threes work with other people, they can be extremely good at  
building company moral and improving team spirit since they have a positive, can-do attitude. They  
are curious, adaptable and like to be in the know about what’s going on in the world. Healthy Threes  
want to make something of themselves so they invest a lot of time and energy into improving  
themselves and their lot in life. Healthy Threes are charming, have good manners and know how to  
“win friends and influence people.” They are sociable, personable, likeable people who put their best  
foot forward and present themselves well. They also know how to motivate, promote, market and  
communicate exceptionally well. They can embody widely admired cultural values whichever country  
they happen to live in (such as attractiveness, physical fitness, wealth, fame, popularity and  
philanthropy in the U.S.). Healthy Threes are truly inspiring and many people aspire to be like them.

**Very healthy Threes** like Deepak Chopra\* and Jack Canfield\* are honest, inspirational, authentically  
self-confident, self-accepting, inner-directed and humbly self-assured. They have intrinsic self-worth  
and genuine self-esteem that has come from developing their talents fully and using them wisely.  
They have gotten in touch with their deeper feelings and thus can be vulnerable, tender, affectionate,  
self-revealing and intimate with others. Very healthy Threes believe in themselves like no other type  
and always strive to be the best they can be at whatever they do under any circumstance. As a result,  
they enjoy a fulfilling personal and professional life, becoming outstanding models of excellence and  
accomplishment. They are supremely proactive and often use their talents and money to further  
causes they believe in.  
* My speculations based on their lives and my experience with the Enneagram

**Average Threes** fear being overshadowed by others so they strive harder to be noticed, to distinguish  
themselves. They are competitive, driven for success and highly concerned about standing out from&nbsp;the crowd, looking good, being somebody. They seek recognition for their accomplishments and  
constantly compare themselves to others to see how they are doing. In their drive for success they  
can become pragmatic, task-focused workaholics, putting their feelings and personal values aside for  
the sake of achieving the recognition they so covet. But they can fear that others are out-doing them  
so they work harder and longer, sometimes neglecting their family and/or health, although their  
appearance is important to them too so some do make time to workout. Their career is extremely  
important to them as it becomes their vehicle for making a name for themselves. Professional  
achievement and social recognition can become all consuming for average Threes. Some average  
Threes are driven by status and prestige while others are more concerned with having material security  
or being successful in the eyes of their family or those they admire.  
Average Threes can be image-conscious and need to look good. They may buy a large house in a  
prestigious neighborhood or an exotic car (that helps them stand out of course) or go for a glamorous  
career (like being an actor or actress) or get more credentials and degrees to impress others. If they  
are athletic (many top-notch athletes are Threes) they will be concerned with setting records, winning  
the trophy or being the best in some way. They may even be concerned about how the people in their  
lives reflect on them. How they are perceived is very important.  
Average Threes like to learn about human behavior techniques, success strategies, winning formulas,  
methods of negotiation and persuasion or anything that will give them an edge on the competition,  
help them win people over or allow them to rise to the top and make a name for themselves. They can  
be smooth talkers, saying or doing whatever they believe will work in a situation.  
Average Threes can be out of integrity with themselves concerning who they are in public versus who  
they are in private. It’s all driven by the need to impress and look good. In public they are highly  
concerned about projecting a winning image, saying the right thing, being likeable, being popular and  
adjusting their behavior and affect to suit the person or situation they are in. However, in private with  
family, under pressure they can be impatient, edgy, cold, calculating, preoccupied and short tempered,  
especially if bothered while working. Many average Threes have focused more on persona  
development to win recognition and praise rather than character and soul development to value  
themselves. They don’t know who they are apart from the images they project to others. As a  
consequence, they can have problems with intimacy in a relationship (and I don’t mean sex) because  
they fear that their charming, “I’ve got it all together,” public façade could be seen through and then  
they’ll lose face. True intimacy is about being REAL with each other and average Threes have a hard  
time opening up their heart, sharing personally, being emotionally vulnerable or bearing their soul to  
their partner. They feel the e need to keep the relationship upbeat and action-oriented so that messy  
feelings don’t get in the way.  
**Unhealthy Threes** want to convince others (and themselves) that they are as successful as the image  
they project. They are desperate for attention, recognition and validation. They are narcissistic and  
often talk about themselves a great deal. They become superficial, self-promoting and self-important.  
They can be ostentatious, pretentious show-offs with grandiose expectations of themselves. They  
don’t just want to be successful, they want to be famous, a star. They have to inflate their talents and  
accomplishments to impress people and bolster their low self-esteem. They can be dishonest, arrogant  
and contemptuous to defend their fragile ego.

**Destructive Threes** do whatever is necessary to support their empty, fraudulent claims. They have  
such an extreme fear of failure that they become deceptive and their life becomes a web of lies. They  
are so detached from their Essential nature (higher self, Divine Being, etc.) that they become devious,  
duplicitous, unscrupulous, exploitative and opportunistic. They don’t want anyone to realize how  
troubled they are so they desperately try to convince others that they still have it all together by  
making up impressive stories about their nonexistent wealth, fame and success. They can become  
true con artists, imposters and swindlers. Even destructive Threes can still be charming and smooth  
talking so some people can be deceived by their concoctions and under-handed schemes. At worst  
they can become hostile, malicious, vengeful and psychopathological.
