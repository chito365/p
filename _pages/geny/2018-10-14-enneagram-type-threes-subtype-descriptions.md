**Which subtype are you?**

## Type #3 Self-Preservation Subtype

sexual 3s) or social status (like social 3s)

**Positive/Enhancing:**  
• Hard working, productive, time efficient, goal-oriented, pragmatic (like 1s)  
• Provide financial security and stability to others  
• Keep physically fit and healthy  
• Responsible, willing to make sacrifices, detail-oriented, thrifty (like 1s)  
• Conscientious about planning for the future, for themselves and loved ones (like 1s)  
• Good team players, get along well with others  
• Keep up with latest developments in their line of work  
• Continually learning and into self-improvement (like 1s)

**Negative/Depleting:**  
• Workaholism and strong identification with their work (like 1s and 8s)  
• Fear of scarcity  
• Work long hours to preserve their security and mitigate anxiety (like 6s)  
• May want the symbols of success (in the U.S. – a fancy car; a nice, big house in the best  
neighborhood; designer clothes; name brands, etc.)  
• May deceive themselves and others by projecting an affluent image  
• Some can neglect relationships and/or health due to heavy workload  
• Losing their job or assets, or an illness that stops them from working, can feel life  
threatening  
• Have trouble taking time off from work, relaxing or even slowing down (like 1s)  
• At worst, anxiety attacks, work burnout and nervous breakdowns

## Type #3 Sexual Subtype

Can resemble Sexual 6s because both are interested in strength (physical and/or intellectual) and  
beauty  
**Positive/Enhancing:**  
• Know how to look attractive: they workout, eat right, pay attention to style and grooming,  
etc.  
• Skilled at one-to-one relating because they are authentic and real rather than pretentious  
• Some choose work that helps others become more attractive  
• Ambitious and hard working  
**Negative/Depleting:**  
• Feel the need to be the ideal gender role model for their culture  
• Want desperately to be perfect and ideal in every way but can’t play the different roles  
simultaneously.

• Try to allure and impress a romantic interest with their charisma, magnetism, success and  
confidence  
• Want to be envied for having a picture perfect relationship with a successful, attractive,  
prestigious mate  
• Cultivate whatever qualities valued others find appealing and desirable  
• Seductive; desire to be valued, wanted and desired  
• Alter their behavior in any way necessary to keep their partner interested in them  
• Fear being able to live up to the image they are projecting (like Sexual 2s)  
• Fear being rejected (like 2s and 4s)  
• Crave yet fear intimacy due to hidden feelings of undesirability (like Sexual 2s and 4s)  
• Identify strongly with their image; can be show-offs  
• Pursue sexual conquests subconsciously believing they will bolster their self-esteem; they  
don’t  
• At worst, can be vindictive, promiscuous, jealous, exhibitionistic or even rageful

## Type #3 Social Subtype

**Positive/Enhancing:**  
• Polite and diplomatic; self-confident and ambitious  
• Excellent social and interpersonal skills; great networkers  
• Get along well with individuals and groups that are very different from each other  
• Charismatic and charming; outgoing and personable  
• Give their time, energy and even money to improve conditions for people and/or the world  
• They always have other people’s welfare in mind as well as their own  
• They can be aware of group expectations but have enough self-esteem to do what’s best  
for them  
**Negative/Depleting:**  
• Seek adulation and recognition from others  
• Adapt and compromise themselves to look good and fit in  
• Socially compare themselves with others; they’re strongly identified with their social role  
• Maintain social standards of appropriateness at all times, even when speaking out is  
necessary  
• Like to be in high-profile positions; desire fame  
• Credentials, degrees, titles, awards, certifications, licenses, etc. are extremely important  
to have  
• Having prestige and a good reputation is very important  
• Believe they are only as good as their achievements  
• Feel the need to prove themselves as anxiety about their social worth increases  
• Can be overly competitive and self-promoting  
• May even take credit for others work and/or exaggerate their success/fame/wealth  
• At worst, become completely dishonest, phony, exploitative and desperate for attention
