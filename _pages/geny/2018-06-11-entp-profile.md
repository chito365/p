ENTPs are energetic individuals who pursue their interests with great drive and enthusiasm.  
As they like to share their enthusiasms with others, ENTPs are often perceived as  
inspirational and can be good at motivating those around them.  
ENTPs abhor routine and get bored very easily. They value spontaneity, variety and room  
for manoeuvre. As a result, ENTPs are usually unconventional. They can spend their lives in  
one career but it is more common for them to move from one interesting project or  
organisation to another. They are often high risk-takers and entrepreneurial by nature.  
Their unconventional approach together with their energy and enthusiasm means ENTPs  
can be stimulating company. They generally have a strong sense of humour and pepper  
their conversation with puns and word play.  
An ENTP’s favourite, or dominant, function is intuition which they prefer to use in the  
extravert world. In effect, this means ENTPs love talking about meaning or possibilities for  
innovative projects. They spend much of their time telling other people about their pet  
theories on life, sharing their observations about what is really going on or engaging others  
in discussions about &#8220;why&#8221; such and such is true.  
ENTPs generally dislike small talk and will either try to get the conversation on to more  
meaningful topics or they will go off and find someone more interesting to talk to. ENTPs  
often enjoy playing devil’s advocate and may even argue both sides of an argument  
simultaneously. Some other MBTI types find it difficult to get on with other people of the  
same type, but generally ENTPs find each other attractive and stimulating company.  
ENTPs have a preference for using thinking in their interior world. When they retreat into  
themselves they evaluate, form opinions, make decisions and plan various courses of  
action. ENTPs often use writing as a way to bring discipline and structure to their ideas. A  
paradox for ENTPs is that while their outer life can be messy and unstructured, their inner  
life is orderly and governed by logic.  
Many ENTPs see life as a puzzle to solve. Their role is understanding what is really going  
on and then improving on it in some way. ENTPs are not content with small changes,  
however, and are usually self-confident and ambitious innovators.  
ENTPs frequently see themselves as part of what they may need to change. Of all the 16  
types, ENTPs see themselves, not as fixed entities, but as individuals with skills,  
experiences and attitudes which are constantly changing, adapting and improving in line  
with the needs of the moment.  
This view of themselves and general approach to life leads most ENTPs to describe  
themselves as &#8220;clever&#8221;. Another word ENTPs frequently choose to describe themselves is  
&#8220;challenging&#8221;. This they see as a positive characteristic and simply means they are not  
prepared to accept anything for the sake of a quiet life. These tendencies are much more  
prevalent in male ENTPs and women’s conditioning usually leads female ENTPs to tone  
down this side of their personality.  
The same characteristics which ENTPs like about themselves other types often find  
irritating. Their need to display their cleverness in the external world can be seen as a desire  
to show off. Their verbal challenges are often interpreted by others as one-upmanship and  
their conversational style can come over as confrontational and &#8220;bolshie&#8221;. ENTPs have  
been known to describe themselves as &#8220;interesting but tiring and hard work&#8221;.  
All Ps struggle with organisation and maintaining order but ENTPs find it particularly hard.  
Their brain is so preoccupied with abstract ideas and possibilities that order and practical  
arrangements are a major challenge. Unless ENTPs have cultivated a methodical approach,  
they may well feel their life might suddenly spin out of control. They know intuitively that  
their scant attention to whether car lights have been turned off, or where keys and tickets  
have been placed could at any moment become a major challenge for them. As they get  
older, most ENTPs become so aware of their potential weakness in this area that they  
become frequent (and irrational) checkers of tickets, money, passports etc.  
It is common for ENTPs to berate themselves for their lack of organisational skills so it is  
important for them to realise that this is really just a downside of one of their strengths. Put  
another way, they are not as organised as they might be because they are flexible,  
spontaneous types of people who like to pursue ideas.  
Ultimately, success in life for ENTPs depends on using their introverted thinking to keep  
their intuition within useful bounds. It is crucially important for ENTPs to learn to resist  
squandering their energy by pursuing too many different things. They must use their  
thinking to discriminate more effectively between an interesting idea and something which is  
worth pursuing. They must also cultivate enough J skills for their projects to bear fruit.
