AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

AJAX is not a new programming language, but a new way to use existing standards.

AJAX is the art of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page &#8211; without reloading the whole page.



## How AJAX Works

## AJAX is Based on Internet Standards

AJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:

  * XMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server)
  * JavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information)
  * CSS (to style the data)
  * XML (often used as the format for transferring data)

<table class="lamp">
  <tr>
    <th style="width:34px;">
      <img src="http://www.w3schools.com/images/lamp.jpg" alt="Note" style="height:32px;width:32px;" />
    </th>
    
    <td>
      AJAX applications are browser- and platform-independent!
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

* * *

## Google Suggest

AJAX was made popular in 2005 by Google, with Google Suggest.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Suggest</a> is using AJAX to create a very dynamic web interface: When you start typing in Google&#8217;s search box, a JavaScript sends the letters off to a server and the server returns a list of suggestions.
