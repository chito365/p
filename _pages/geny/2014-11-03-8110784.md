This are short notes i made on one of the lectures.

&#8220;In this Module, we have three parts, viz. Various addressing modes Machine Instruction. We have examined the types of operands and operations that may be specified by machine instructions.

Now we have to see how is the address of an operand specified, and how are the bits of an instruction organized to define the operand addresses and operation of that instruction. Addressing Modes:

The most common addressing techniques are:

Immediate Direct Indirect Register Register Indirect Displacement Stack All computer architectures provide more than one of these addressing modes.

The question arises as to how the control unit can determine which addressing mode is being used in a particular instruction.&#8221;

Thank you.
