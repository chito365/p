            Check the distance on map prior
          </h1>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          It is not uncommon for hotels to slightly exaggerate their proximity to attractions and amenities around town. If being close to a particular airport or landmark is important for your trip, verify distances on Google Maps before you book a hotel.

          <strong>Skip the Package Deals</strong>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          To entice new guests, some hotels will offer themed package deals that sound exciting but may not be worth it. Just know that sometimes these packages include things you don&#8217;t even want or need and that the special rate could be higher than the regular rate.

          <strong>Don&#8217;t Pay for the Mini Bar</strong>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          Mini bar charges are frequently disputed because they are stocked by hand and often miscalculated. Carefully review your hotel&#8217;s itemized bill and if you see any mini bar charges that aren&#8217;t right, dispute them. Most front desk staff won&#8217;t hesitate to void the charges.

          Understand Room Preferences Aren&#8217;t Guaranteed
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          Hotel bookings include preferences like bed size and the number of beds. But in many hotels, travelers should know that these preferences aren&#8217;t guaranteed. You&#8217;ll usually get what you asked for, but not always.

          Mention Special Occasions
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          Many of us travel for birthdays, anniversaries, and special events. Mention what you&#8217;re celebrating to the hotel staff a week or more before you arrive and you might be surprised with a little perk, like a bottle of champagne in your room.

          <strong>Be Courteous to the Staff</strong>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          A little niceness goes a long way, especially with hotel staff that has to deal with difficult guests on a regular basis. When you check in, simply ask how the front desk clerk&#8217;s day is going and say hello to the cleaning staff when you pass them in the hall. This isn&#8217;t just common courtesy, but it also increases your chances of getting perks during your stay.

          <strong>Ask About Parking</strong>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          Especially when you stay in large cities, parking costs really add up. Look for hotels that offer free or discounted parking rates. If hotel parking is expensive, apps like Best Parking can help you find nearby parking garages for cheaper rates if you don&#8217;t mind walking a bit.

          <strong>Bundle a Hotel Stay with Airfare</strong>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          If you&#8217;ve gotten your trip all planned out and know your itinerary, consider bundling your hotel room with your airfare for a better price. Some websites offer travel packages that combine both accommodations and flights, which can help you save significantly on your hotel room.

          Ask for a Corner Room
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          When you check in at a hotel, discretely ask if there&#8217;s a corner room available. These are usually larger and quieter for the same price as ones in the middle of the hall. Upgrades are most often offered at the end of the day when hotels have a better sense of their occupancy.

          <strong>Pack Earplugs</strong>
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip-text">
          Excess noise and annoyances are part of the travel experience, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they have to drive you crazy. Pack a good pair or two of earplugs for your flight and hotel room, just in case.
