  1. Feed Your Strengths! Encourage your natural artistic abilities and creativity. Nourish your spirituality. Give yourself opportunities to help the needy or underprivileged.
  2. Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some traits are strengths and some are weaknesses. Facing and dealing with your weaknesses doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to change who you are; it means that you want to be the best you possible. By facing your weaknesses, you are honoring your true self, rather than attacking yourself.
  3. Express Your Feelings. Don&#8217;t let unexpressed emotions build up inside of you. If you have strong feelings, sort them out and express them, donâ€™t let them build up inside you to the point where they become unmanageable!
  4. Listen to Everything. Try not to dismiss anything immediately. Let everything soak in for awhile, and then apply judgment.
  5. Smile at Criticism. Remember that people will not always agree with you or understand you, even if they value you greatly. Try to see disagreement and criticism as an opportunity for growth. In fact, that is exactly what it is.
  6. Be Aware of Others. Remember that there are 15 other personality types out there who see things differently than you see them. Try to identify other people&#8217;s types. Try to understand their perspectives.

<ol start="7">
  <li>
    Be Accountable for Yourself. Remember that YOU have more control over your life than any other person has.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be Gentle in Your Expectations. You will always be disappointed with others if you expect too much of them. Being disappointed with another person is the best way to drive them away. Treat others with the same gentleness that you would like to be treated with.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assume the Best. Don&#8217;t distress yourself by assuming the worst. Remember that a positive attitude often creates positive situations.
  </li>
  <li>
    When in Doubt, Ask Questions! Don&#8217;t assume that the lack of feedback is the same thing as negative feedback. If you need feedback and don&#8217;t have any, ask for it.
  </li>
</ol>
