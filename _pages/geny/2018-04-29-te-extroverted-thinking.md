    <span data-offset-key="9p93g-0-1">ETJs love a challenge, especially one that will allow tangible improvement in productivity, efficiency or profitability. They are direct, finding the quickest, most direct path between what is and what should be. ETJs love a problem, especially one that will make full use of their competencies, their logic and sense of order, justice and fair play. Many Te types find competition to be stimulating and fun. Fairness and respecting the same set of rules, so may the best one win. And since they readily acknowledge that there will be a winner and a loser, they would simply much rather be the winner. So they hone their strategies on the fine knife of experience and sharpen their skills to meet the next challenge head on. ETJs love having greater challenges bestowed on them as a result of having successfully met the last, as this attests to their competence and skills. </span><span data-offset-key="9p93g-0-2">Directness:</span><span data-offset-key="9p93g-0-3"> Te types are direct and honest with most things that displease them and expect others to do the same. Their communication style is honest direct, and to the point, and the prefer others to be similarly candid with them. </span>

They are quick to organize, orchestrate, find resources, coordinate, and follow through to the end of a project. Te types are seen by others and see themselves as having rigorous standards that typically take precedence over both their own, and others’ personal needs. </span>

  </h4>
  
  <div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="n0bk-0-0">
    <span data-offset-key="n0bk-0-1">Te is checking for consequences, monitoring for standards or specifications being met and deciding if something is working or not. Te is setting boundaries, guidelines and parameters. In written or verbal communication, Te helps us notice when something is missing. Te harmonizes us with the general ideas about reality, so most the standards of order we employ are collectively determined. When one uses Te, they are recognizing that certain principles of order are “always true”. The “truth” of Te, in this respect, is not its scientific accuracy but its rational utility. It doesn’t matter that other cultures have conceptualized times, space, and seasonal progression differently than we do. The bottom line is that our Te principles are reliable enough to use as consensual benchmarks, thereby freeing us from the dictates of immediate experience. Te is a social language—a vocabulary that creates common ground, rights, and expectations among people whose life experiences may be very different. </span>
