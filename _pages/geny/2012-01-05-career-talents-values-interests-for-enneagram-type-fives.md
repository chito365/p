they are based on other systems (click on the links below to see what I mean):

**So, what DO Albert Einstein and Amelia Earhart have in common, both**  
**being Enneagram type Fives?**

As cerebral types, all Fives are mentally curious, even mentally intense. They have a  
great thirst for knowledge and want to deeply understand whatever they’re interested in. Fives  
are extremely independent, self-reliant, self-sufficient and somewhat private, even when in a  
loving relationship. They generally need lots of freedom and personal space to pursue their own  
projects alone, or perhaps with one other person. Fives hate to feel overwhelmed by others’  
emotions and many Fives are extremely career-oriented since relating emotionally doesn’t come  
easily for them. They feel much more in control and comfortable thinking, analyzing and learning  
than they do engaging their feelings. Fives are individualistic; they aren’t as concerned about  
societal pressures or material possessions as most of the other types. They feel most alive when  
they are getting new insights into some complex problem they have been working on  
understanding. Doesn’t that sound like both Albert Einstein and Amelia Earhart?  
Fives can have either a Four wing or a Three wing. Albert Einstein is a Five with a  
Four wing and Amelia Earhart is a Five with a Six wing. If, after clicking on the previous  
links, you feel that you are more of a Five with a strong Four wing, look at what Enneagram type  
Fours need for career satisfaction as well. If you feel you are more of a Five with a strong Six  
wing, look at what Enneagram type Sixes need for career satisfaction as well.

**Average to unhealthy Fives** are most often intelligent (high IQ) but can lack social skills  
and emotional intelligence about themselves and others (low EQ). They can sometimes have  
trouble articulating their deep thoughts and insights so that others can understand them. Thus,  
average to unhealthy Fives often take jobs that don’t require much interaction with other people.  
It can be difficult for average to unhealthy Fives to watch others with better social skills and greater emotional intelligence do better professionally even though others usually have less  
intelligence or technical expertise.  
**Healthy Fives** are extraordinarily perceptive, insightful, creative and often innovative.  
They have learned how to overcome their social insecurities and put their knowledge and insights  
out into the world (with their healthy connection to type 8). They often become experts in their  
field and some even make pioneering discoveries or create great works of art. Examples of  
healthy Fives are Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, Oliver Sacks, Linus Pauling, Thomas  
Edison, René Descartes, Alfred Kinsey, Bobby Fischer, Gary Larson, Agatha Christie,  
John Lennon, B.F. Skinner, Georgia O’Keeffe, Stephen King and Charles Darwin.
