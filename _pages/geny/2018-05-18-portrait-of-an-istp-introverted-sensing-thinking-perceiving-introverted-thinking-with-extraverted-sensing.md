As an ISTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.

&nbsp;

ISTP&#8217;s have a compelling drive to understand the way things work. They&#8217;re good at logical analysis, and like to use it on practical concerns. They typically have strong powers of reasoning, although they&#8217;re not interested in theories or concepts unless they can see a practical application. They like to take things apart and see the way they work.

&nbsp;

ISTP’s have an adventuresome spirit. They are attracted to motorcycles, airplanes, sky diving, surfing, etc. They thrive on action, and are usually fearless. ISTP’s are fiercely independent, needing to have the space to make their own decisions about their next step. They do not believe in or follow rules and regulations, as this would prohibit their ability to &#8220;do their own thing&#8221;. Their sense of adventure and desire for constant action makes ISTP’s prone to becoming bored rather quickly.

&nbsp;

ISTP’s are loyal to their causes and beliefs, and are firm believers that people should be treated with equity and fairness. Although they do not respect the rules of the &#8220;System&#8221;, they follow their own rules and guidelines for behavior faithfully. They will not take part in something which violates their personal laws. ISTP’s are extremely loyal and faithful to their &#8220;brothers&#8221;.

&nbsp;

ISTP’s like and need to spend time alone, because this is when they can sort things out in their minds most clearly. They absorb large quantities of impersonal facts from the external world, and sort through those facts, making judgments, when they are alone.

&nbsp;

ISTP’s are action-oriented people. They like to be up and about, doing things. They are not people to sit behind a desk all day and do long-range planning. Adaptable and spontaneous, they respond to what is immediately before them. They usually have strong technical skills, and can be effective technical leaders. They focus on details and practical things. They have an excellent sense of expediency and grasp of the details which enables them to make quick, effective decisions.

&nbsp;

ISTP’s avoid making judgments based on personal values &#8211; they feel that judgments and decisions should be made impartially, based on the fact. They are not naturally tuned in to how they are affecting others. They do not pay attention to their own feelings, and even distrust them and try to ignore them, because they have difficulty distinguishing

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

between emotional reactions and value judgments. This may be a problem area for many ISTP’s.

&nbsp;

An ISTP who is over-stressed may exhibit rash emotional outbursts of anger, or on the other extreme may be overwhelmed by emotions and feelings which they feel compelled to share with people (often inappropriately). An ISTP who is down on themselves will foray into the world of value judgments &#8211; a place which is not natural for the ISTP &#8211; and judge themselves by their inability to perform some task. They will then approach the task in a grim emotional state, expecting the worst.

&nbsp;

ISTP’s are excellent in a crisis situations. They&#8217;re usually good athletes, and have very good hand-eye coordination. They are good at following through with a project, and tying up loose ends. They usually don&#8217;t have much trouble with school, because they are introverts who can think logically. They are usually patient individuals, although they may be prone to occasional emotional outbursts due to their inattention to their own feelings.

&nbsp;

ISTP’s have a lot of natural ability which makes them good at many different kinds of things. However, they are happiest when they are centered in action-oriented tasks which require detailed logical analysis and technical skill. They take pride in their ability to take the next correct step.

&nbsp;

ISTP’s are optimistic, full of good cheer, loyal to their equals, uncomplicated in their desires, generous, trusting and receptive people who want no part in confining commitments.

**I****STP’s** **generally** **h****ave** **th****e** **following** **t****raits:** &nbsp;Interested in how and why things work<!--nextpage-->

&nbsp;Do not function well in regimented, structured environments; they will either feel stifled or become intensely bored

&nbsp;Constantly gather facts about their environment and store them away

&nbsp;Have an excellent ability to apply logic and reason to their immense store of facts to solve problems or discover how things work

&nbsp;Learn best &#8220;hands-on&#8221;

&nbsp;Usually able to master theory and abstract thinking, but don&#8217;t particularly like dealing with it unless they see a practical application

&nbsp;Action-oriented &#8220;doers&#8221;

&nbsp;Focused on living in the present, rather than the future &nbsp;Love variety and new experiences

&nbsp;Highly practical and realistic

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Excellent &#8220;trouble-shooters&#8221;, able to quickly find solutions to a wide variety of practical problems

&nbsp;Results-oriented; they like to see immediate results for their efforts &nbsp;Usually laid-back and easy-going with people

&nbsp;Risk-takers who thrive on action

&nbsp;Independent and determined &#8211; usually dislike committing themselves &nbsp;Usually quite self-confident

&nbsp;

The ISTP is fortunate because they have the abilities to be good at many different kinds of tasks. Their introverted and thinking preferences give them the ability to concentrate and work through problems which leaves many doors open to them. However, to be happiest, the ISTP needs to lead a lifestyle which offers a great deal of autonomy and does not include much external enforcement of structure. ISTP’s will do best working for themselves, or working in very flexible environments. Their natural interests lie towards applying their excellent reasoning skills against known facts and data to discover underlying structure, or solutions to practical questions.

&nbsp;

**I****STP** **Relationships**

ISTP’s are generally extremely capable individuals who are good at most things which interest them. They are usually bright, interesting, and exciting individuals with a lot to offer. They live almost entirely in the present moment, and usually do not make commitments beyond the immediate foreseeable future. An ISTP probably coined the phrase &#8220;nothing is unconditional&#8221;. They strongly prefer to take things one day at a time, rather than make long-term commitments. If a relationship interests them and satisfies their needs, the ISTP will do their part on a daily basis to keep the relationship strong and healthy. If they lose interest in a relationship, their natural tendency will be to move on.
