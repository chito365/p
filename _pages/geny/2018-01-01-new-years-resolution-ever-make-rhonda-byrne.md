                                A new year means New Year’s resolutions for many people. I want to share with you the only New Year’s resolution I ever make. &nbsp;This one New Year’s resolution is all encompassing &#8211; it will take care of all your other resolutions in one go, whether that’s to find love, lose weight, be healthier, make more money, or whatever it is you want for 2018.

                              <div>
                                Being positive means that you will look for the positive things in people, circumstances, and all things.
                              </div>

                                Being positive means that if any negative words come out of your mouth, you will stop mid-sentence and immediately turn the sentence into a positive one.
                              </div>

                              <div>
                                Being positive means that you will have fewer negative emotions, and even if a negative emotion arises you will be positive about it too by allowing the negative emotion to be rather than trying to push it away.
                              </div>

                                Being positive means that you will automatically focus on what you want, not on what you don’t want.
                              </div>

                                Being positive means that you will become an attractive force for what you want.
