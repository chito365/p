## So, what DO Audrey Hepburn and Carl Jung have in common, both being  
Enneagram type Nines?

All Nines seem to have a modest, unassuming, almost egoless persona. There’s a genuine  
easygoingness, guilelessness and simplicity about them that makes them appear open-minded,  
nonjudgmental and patient. Nines are motivated by the need to keep their peace of mind and for  
that reason they are often called “peacemakers” who dislike conflict more than just about any  
other type. They make natural mediators, counselors, diplomats and negotiators because they  
are so good at seeing other peoples’ points of view. They also tend to have a live-and-let-live  
attitude as they are better at accepting people for who they are than any other type. Nines  
sincerely desire to contribute to humanity in their own unpretentious way. **Doesn’t that sound**  
**like both Audrey Hepburn and Carl Jung.**

Nines can have either an Eight wing or a One wing. Carl Jung is a Nine with an Eight  
wing and Audrey Hepburn is a Nine with a One wing. If, after clicking on the previous links,  
you feel that you are more of a Nine with a strong Eight wing, look at what Enneagram type  
Eights need for career satisfaction as well. If you feel you are more of a Nine with a strong One  
wing, look at what Enneagram type Ones need for career satisfaction as well.  
Average to unhealthy Nines don’t seem to be aware of their own needs, priorities and  
ambitions. They are so interested in keeping their peace of mind and keeping life comfortable  
that they just blindly merge with the wishes of others and assume roles that their environment  
beckons them to play. As a consequence, average to unhealthy Nines can just fall into a job for  
years that they don’t even particularly like but it provides the financial stability and comfortable  
routine that they do like. Many of these Nines go to career counselors not having a clue who they

are or what they would really like to do but they feel apathetic, empty and numb inside so they  
know something is wrong. In Enneagram language they have been asleep to themselves and are  
starting to wake up. If you are a Nine, learn to get in touch with your own needs and priorities by  
noticing when you compromise yourself and your desires for the sake of peace, harmony, comfort  
and predictability.  
Healthy Nines are fully present to themselves, others and the world around them. They  
have discovered their enormous inner strength and ability to unify people and truly heal conflicts.  
They give to others generously and manage their world in a way that benefits everyone they care  
about. Examples of healthy Nines are Abraham Lincoln, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Kevin  
Costner, The (14  
th  
) Dalai Lama, Jimmy Stewart, Ringo Starr, Dwight Eisenhower, Julia  
Child and Woody Harrelson.
