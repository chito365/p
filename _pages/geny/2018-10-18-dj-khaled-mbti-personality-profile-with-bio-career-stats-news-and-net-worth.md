## Born and Raised in Louisiana

Born as Khaled Mohamed Khaled** **on November 26, 1975 in New Orleans, Louisiana, DJ Khaled was exposed to music at a young age. His Palestinian parents were musicians who encouraged their son&#8217;s love for rap and soul music. He has a brother, Alec Ledd (Alla Khaled), who is an actor.

## How DJ Khaled Became Famous

Khaled began working in record stores, helping artists like Lil Wayne and Birdman in their music careers before they made it big. After jumping into the DJ circuit, Khaled moved to Miami in 1998 where he began working in radio, co-hosting with Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew on _The Luke Show_ on WEDR &#8220;99 Jamz.&#8221; A few years later he snagged his own weeknight radio show at the station. Throughout his career, he has gone through many monikers: Arab Attack, Terror Squadian, Beat Novacane, Big Dog Pitbull and Mr. Miami, to name a few. As a music producer, he&#8217;s worked on rap and hip-hop albums like _True Story_ by Terror Squad, _Real Talk _by Fabolous, and _All or Nothing_ by Fat Joe .

## From &#8216;Listennn&#8230; the Album&#8217; to No. 1&#8217;s &#8216;Major Key&#8217; and &#8216;Grateful&#8217;

In 2006 Khaled released his debut album entitled _Listennn&#8230; the Album_, which successfully reached no. 12 on the Billboard 200 charts. A year later he also received attention for the release of his sophomore album _We the Best_, which featured chart topping singles like &#8220;I&#8217;m So Hood&#8221; and &#8220;We Takin Over,&#8221; collaborating with notable artists like Rick Ross, Akon, T.I., Fat Joe and Lil Wayne. Riding on a wave of success, Khaled launched his own record label, We the Best Music Group, and became president of Def Jam South in 2009.

In 2010 Khaled&#8217;s single &#8220;All I Do I Win,&#8221; featuring the likes of Ludacris and Snoop Dogg, went double platinum as he continued to work his magic collaborating with big stars and churning out albums, which include _We the Best Forever_ (2011), _Suffering from Success_ (2013), _I Changed A Lot_ (2015) and _Major Key_ (2016), which gave him his first no. 1 album in his career. In 2017 his tenth studio album, _Grateful_, became his second album to hit no. 1 and included his very first no. 1 single &#8220;I&#8217;m the One,&#8221; featuring Justin Bieber and rappers Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne.
