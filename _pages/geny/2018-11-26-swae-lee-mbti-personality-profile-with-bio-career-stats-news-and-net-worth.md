### **Swae Lee Facts**

While studying in high school, he used to play football in the school. He was a wide receiver and claimed that he was pretty good at it.

Before he found fame as a rapper, he used to work in a local mattress factory. His job was to put pillows together that came down the line. He had to work in 12 hours shift there.

Before hitting it big in the music industry, Swae and his brother used to perform at local parties.

In his early childhood, he had to move around a lot due to his mother’s army job.

Swae was raised in Ida Street housing projects, which is one of the most notorious and crime-ridden neighborhoods of Tupelo, Mississippi. His father had abandoned his family just a couple of years after Swae’s birth.

As they started focusing on rapping while in high school, they often used to return home late in the night, which led to their mother kicking them out. Swae and his brother had to search for shelter in abandoned houses.

In 2016, Swae and his brother collaborated to establish record label, SremmLife Crew Records. They signed up a couple of Mississippi based rappers to the label.

While studying in high school, Swae and his older brother formed a hip-hop group, Dem Outta St8 Boyz. Jemiah Middlebrooks was the other member of the group.

Swae and his brother were advised by Atlanta based producer Pierre “P-Nasty” Slaughter to move to Atlanta, where they performed in a number of talent shows.

They had to return from Atlanta due to financial problems. They also had to stop producing music for some time.
