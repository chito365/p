Most people don’t have a personal mission statement which is why I am including some here  
based on each Enneagram type’s innate gifts, talents, interests and values. A personal mission  
statement is nothing more than a brief written statement of your overall purpose in life, your  
personal vision for who you want to be in and for the world. Helen Keller once said, “The most  
pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but has no vision.” I would use the word  
pitiable (as in evoking compassion) instead of pathetic but otherwise I agree with her. Without a  
“why” to live for that makes a contribution life quickly becomes empty and meaningless.

1. My mission is to bring more philosophical, spiritual and historical understanding to humanity  
through my writings  
2. My mission is to conduct qualitative and quantitative chemical analyses to develop new  
products and knowledge  
3. My mission is to conduct research into the phases of physical phenomena and develop  
theories and laws on the basis of observation and experiments  
4. My mission is to write computer programs that help people run their businesses more  
efficiently  
5. My mission is to restore antique furniture that people can cherish for a lifetime  
6. My mission is to research a cure for cancer  
7. My mission is to invent devices that give people more autonomy and better quality of life  
8. My mission is to investigate the relationship between organisms and disease and the effects of  
antibiotics on microorganisms  
9. My mission is to research and write about human sexuality in a way that will profoundly  
influence social and cultural values  
10. My mission is to observe, research and interpret celestial and astronomical phenomena to  
increase basic knowledge and apply such information to practical problems
