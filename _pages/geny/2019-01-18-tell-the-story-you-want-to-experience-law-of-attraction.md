To live deliberately, you have to think deliberately; and in order to do that, you must have a reference point in order to determine the correct direction of your thought. Right now, just as at the time of your birth, the two necessary factors are in place. The _Law of Attraction_ (the most powerful and consistent _Law_ in the Universe) abounds. And your _Guidance System_ is within you, all queued up and ready to give you directional feedback. _You have only one seemingly small but potentially life-changing thing to do: <u>You have to begin telling your story in a new way. You have to tell it as</u> you <u>want it to be.</u>_

_ _

As you tell the story of your life (and you do it nearly all day, every day with your words, your thoughts, and your actions), you have to feel good while you tell it. _In every moment, about every subject, you can focus positively or negatively, for in every particle of the Universe—in every moment in time and beyond—there is that which is wanted and the lack of what is wanted pulsing there for you to choose between._ And as these constant choices reveal themselves to you; you have the option of focusing upon what you want or the lack of it regarding every subject, because every subject is really two subjects: what you want or the absence of what you want. You can tell, by the way you feel, which choice you are currently focused upon—and you can change your choice constantly.
