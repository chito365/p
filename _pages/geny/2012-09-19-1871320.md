MTOI: Dad, did you tell the pastor that mum&#8217;s death has left a big gap in our family?&nbsp;[](http://click.buzzcity.net/click.php?partnerid=82408&label=ns) FATHER: Yes.

MTOI: But the gap on the wall of our house has been there and i saw my brother filling it with mud today?

FATHER: No, I meant that the number of us in the family has reduced after her death.

MTOI: Then if so, why did the pastor write an additional sign on her grave?

FATHER: So that God would add her name in the book of life!
