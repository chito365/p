**1. [Ti &#8211; internal Thinking](https://www.afriqueunique.org/ti-introverted-thinking/)**  
TiNe&#8217;s use Ti to make decisions based on logical analysis done over time in their heads. Ti is the reason they prize rationality and objectivity. It also drives their insatiable thirst for knowledge and learning. Because it is their strongest preference, the functions below are said to &#8220;serve&#8221; the Ti. This just means that the Ti way of doing things gets priority most of the time.&nbsp;

**2. [Ne &#8211; external iNtuition](https://www.afriqueunique.org/ne-extroverted-intuition/)**  
Ne is the main way TiNe’s take in information. It means they use their intuition to find patterns,&nbsp;underlying principles, and ideas, to construct theories and frameworks, and to form connections as they talk, write, or create. It can make them seem quite &#8220;rambley&#8221; at times as they can jump from topic to topic based on the connections they&#8217;re making in the moment rather than following a more linear path of conversation.

**3. [Si &#8211; internal Sensing](https://www.afriqueunique.org/si-introverted-sensing/)**  
Si is the TiNe’s third function, and it allows them to store all the interesting facts and knowledge they gather in their brain in an organized way for future reference. Si also makes the Ti-led internal world fairly structured and detailed in its analysis, and can often lead to a very strong sense of internal stability which can come across as arrogance to others. While they can jump from topic to topic in conversation, internally their thought patterns are more linear.&nbsp;For TiNe&#8217;s in particular, their Si drives them to have a high need for precise language, and they can often articulate themselves very well when they want to. As they get older, their thought processes get faster. After some time they will likely not need to consciously think through every step in a thought process unless they&#8217;re taking on a very novel problem or task.

**4. [Fe &#8211; external Feeling](https://www.afriqueunique.org/fe-extroverted-feeling/)**  
Fe is the TiNe’s last function. As a last function, it is inherently not as strong as the other functions and the TiNe generally prefers to only use it where necessary, rather than using to make all their decisions. Fe is the TiNe’s humanitarian side. It causes them to want to use their intelligence and creative problem-solving to help others and fix the world in some way. Having Fe last means that TiNe’s often start out life being less aware of and equipped to deal with feelings than other types. Even though it&#8217;s last, a healthy TiNe will learn to develop all of their functions over time so they can use them as needed.
