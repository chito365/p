_ESFPs represent approximately 8-10% of the [American](https://www.afriqueunique.org/tag/american/) population_

ESFPs are friendly, warm, and energetic people who usually have a wide and varied circle of friends. They are active, talkative, and easy going with a love of life that is infectious to everyone around them. They look for and find fun in everything they do and are at their best when they are busy doing things with people they enjoy. Realistic, sensible and down to earth, ESFPs are good with details, and have great memories for the facts that pertain to people.

They tend to be pleasant but skeptical about accepting theories or approaches with which they have no personal experience. Their social nature sometimes distracts them from their commitments and they can find themselves over committed because it is so difficult to turn down invitations.

Because ESFPs take a personal approach to life, they can get their feelings hurt when others are not as generous or loving as they are. They base their decisions almost exclusively on their personal feelings and experiences, and can fail to see more logical consequences of their actions. They need to work at staying objective and reading between the lines to get a more accurate view of the big picture.
