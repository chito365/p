  1. Feed Your Strengths! Realize your gift at mastering your physical environment, and give yourself plenty of opportunities to exercise your abilities. Ride, play, paint, work it. Much of your sense of well-being will come from these experiences.
  2. Face Your Weaknesses! Face your fear of the unknown, and get yourself into new situations. Experience new activities and people with new perspectives. Don&#8217;t isolate yourself into a narrow and lonely existence.
  3. Talk About Your Thoughts. Discussing your ideas and perceptions with others will help you to develop your Extraverted Sensing, and thus your understanding of the world. How well you use your auxiliary function is very important to your overall health and happiness.
  4. Don&#8217;t Be Afraid to Love. That&#8217;s just your old inferior function trying to convince you that you&#8217;re unloved and unlovable. It&#8217;s not true. Just because you&#8217;re not sure what to do with yourself doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t learn! Go on&#8230; jump in. The water&#8217;s warm.
  5. Respect Your Need for Action. Understand that you need to be actively working with your environment to be &#8220;in the groove&#8221; with life. Don&#8217;t chastise yourself for not being the sort to sit around and read a book or watch a movie. Choose a partner and companions who value active lifestyles.
  6. Recognize Social Principles. Realize that our society functions around some basic social principles, and that our society would fail unless those principles are recognized and upheld. In a democracy, people vote. At a red stoplight, people stop. If people stopped voting because it wasn&#8217;t important to their own way of life, who would be in power? If people stopped stopping at red stop lights because it didn&#8217;t fit into their way of life, how could we drive safely? Your priorities and beliefs are important, but you must recognize that the external world&#8217;s agenda is also important. Don&#8217;t dismiss the importance of principles that don&#8217;t affect your life directly.
  7. It&#8217;s OK to Get Out of your Comfort Zone. Understand that the only way to grow is to get outside of your comfort zone. If you&#8217;re uncomfortable with an idea or situation because you&#8217;re not sure how to act, that&#8217;s good! That&#8217;s an opportunity for growth.
  8. Identify and Express Your Feelings. You may have a hard time figuring out exactly how you feel about someone that you&#8217;re involved with. It&#8217;s important that you do figure this out. Don&#8217;t lead someone on with your ambivalence. If you determine that you value the person, tell them so every time you think of it. This

&nbsp;

is the best way to make them feel secure in your affections, and so to promote a long-lasting relationship.

    Be Aware of Others. Try to really identify where people are coming from. Their ideas, thoughts and priorities are different from yours. They have something to offer you. Try to identify their personality types.

    Assume the Best. Don&#8217;t distress yourself with fear and dark imaginings. Expect the best, and the best will come.
