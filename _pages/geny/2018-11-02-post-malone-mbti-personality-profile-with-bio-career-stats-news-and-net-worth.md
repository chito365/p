  1. **Ashlen** – Post Malone was reported to be in a relationship with a woman named Ashlen. She had booked him for a show at the nightclub. Their relationship blossomed thereafter. The relationship became public in the early months of 2015 after they showed up together for the radio show, _The Breakfast Club. _There was a slight controversy at the show as the show host Charlamagne Tha God hinted that Malone might cheat on his girlfriend in near future. They had broken up for a short while after the interview. However, they got back together after some months later and appeared together for another interview with _The Breakfast Club _in December 2016. Judging by the lack of their pictures together on their respective social media accounts, it seems they might have gone separate ways.<figure id="attachment_65618" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
