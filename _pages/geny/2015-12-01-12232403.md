<div>
  The mental model
</div>

<div>
  • Mental models are structures in long term&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  memory.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • They consist of elements and relations between&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  those elements.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  They represent relevant knowledge structures &nbsp;• They represent relevant knowledge structures&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  analogous to physical, organizational, and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  procedural structures in the world.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • These mental models become instantiated when&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  activated by an actual need arising to make a&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  decision related to an element of this knowledge.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  The mental model
</div>

<div>
  • People tend to form their own mental model of a&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  system. For example:
</div>

<div>
  • a video card game player visualizes cards on a&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  table,
</div>

<div>
  • a video golf game player can image actually &nbsp;• a video golf game player can image actually&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  playing golf,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • a flight simulator gives the user a realistic sense&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  of flying an airplane.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • The mental model helps the user understand how&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  the system works.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  The mental model
</div>

<div>
  • A good mental model allows the user to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  predict the system’s response to a given&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  stimulus, and the more accurate those&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  predictions, the more intuitive the system&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  appears.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • When the user understands the system at an&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  intuitive level, the need for training declines,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  the error rate improves, and the user becomes&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  more efficient.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  The mental model
</div>

<div>
  • When designing a user interface, the designer&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  should try to select a mental model that makes&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  sense to the user. For example,
</div>

<div>
  • If the user filled out a paper form in the old&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  system, that form might be simulated on the&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  screen.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • If the mental model cannot be based on the&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  user’s experience, the user must be trained to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  understand the new mental model and the&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  designer must be prepared to adjust the model if&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  the user has trouble understanding it.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  The mental model
</div>

<div>
  • A good approach is to adopt a known&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  metaphor such as the Microsoft Windows&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  desktop.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • There is no point reinventing the wheel, and &nbsp;• There is no point reinventing the wheel, and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  time spent on Windows training might&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  simplify training for future applications.
</div>

<div>
  How can Mental Models be applied in Software&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  Design?
</div>

<div>
  • Software interfaces should be designed to help users&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  build productive mental models of a system.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • (Preece, 1994) Common design methods employed to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  support and influence users’ mental models include:&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  –simplicity,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  –familiarity, &nbsp;–familiarity,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  –availability,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  –flexibility,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  –feedback,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  –safety,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  –affordances.
</div>

<div>
  Simplicity
</div>

<div>
  • Since mental models simplify reality, interface design&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  should simplify actual computer functions.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • A function should only be included if a task analysis&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  shows it is needed.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Basic, most frequently used functions should be&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  immediately apparent, while advanced functions&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  should be less obvious to users.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Cluttering an interface with many advanced functions&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  only distracts users from accomplishing their goals.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • A well-organized interface that supports users’ tasks&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  fades into the background and allows the user to work&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  efficiently.
</div>

<div>
  Familiarity
</div>

<div>
  • An interface should allow users to build on prior&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  knowledge, especially knowledge gained from&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  experience interacting in the world.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • The use of concepts and techniques that users&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  already understand from their real world&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  experiences allows them to get started quickly&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  and make progress immediately.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • The Windows operating system (and originally&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  the Apple system) uses an office metaphor to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  leverage existing knowledge in this way.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  Familiarity
</div>

<div>
  • Its folder and document icons combined with drag and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  drop functionality, allow users to grasp basic concepts&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  more quickly than traditional command-based systems.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • A small amount of knowledge used consistently&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  throughout an interface can empower the user to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  accomplish a large number of tasks.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Concepts and techniques can be learned once and then&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  applied in a variety of situations.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • By choosing to be consistent with something the user&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  already understands, an interface can be made easier&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  to learn, more productive, and even fun to use.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  Availability
</div>

<div>
  • An interface should provide visual cues,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  reminders, lists of choices, and other aids,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  either automatically or on request.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Humans are much better at recognition than &nbsp;• Humans are much better at recognition than&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  recall.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Users should never have to rely on their own&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  memory for something the system already&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  knows, such as previous settings, file names,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  and other interface details.
</div>

<div>
  Flexibility
</div>

<div>
  • An interface should support alternate&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  interaction techniques, allowing users to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  choose the method of interaction that is most&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  appropriate to their situation.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Users should be able to use any object in any&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  sequence at any time.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Flexible interfaces are able to accommodate a&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  wide range of user skills, physical abilities,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  interactions, and usage environments.
</div>

<div>
  Feedback
</div>

<div>
  • A system should provide complete and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  continuous feedback about the results of actions.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • (Norman, 1988) Any feedback a user gets that&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  supports their current mental model strengthens&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  it.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Feedback that contradicts the current mental&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  model causes it to adapt.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • (Sears, 1997) Immediate feedback allows users to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  assess whether the results were what they&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  expected and take alternative action immediately&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  if necessary.
</div>

<div>
  Safety
</div>

<div>
  • A user&#8217;s actions should cause the results the user&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  expects.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Users should feel confident in exploring, knowing&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  they can try an action, view the result, and undo&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  the action if the result is unacceptable.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Users feel more comfortable with interfaces in&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  which their actions do not cause irreversible&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  consequences.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  Affordances
</div>

<div>
  • An affordance refers to the properties of an object (&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  the kinds of operations and manipulations that can be&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  done to the particular object).&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • For example, a chair affords support and sitting; glass&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  affords seeing through and breaking; folders afford&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  opening and storing files; a trash can affords throwing&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  something away.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Affordances provide clues to how an object can be &nbsp;• Affordances provide clues to how an object can be&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  used.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Perceived affordance is what a person thinks can be&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  done with an object.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • An interface can take advantage of affordances by&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  using real-world representations of objects in the&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  interface. Users will intuitively know what to do with&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  the object just by looking. (Norman, 1988)
</div>

<div>
  How do we Capture and Validate Users&#8217; Mental&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  Models?
</div>

<div>
  1. Task Analysis
</div>

<div>
  • Task analysis is the process of identifying and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  understanding users&#8217; goals and tasks, the strategies they&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  use to perform the tasks, the tools they currently use, any&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  problems they experience, and the changes they would like&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  to see in their tasks and tools.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Tasks may include those that involve the computer and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  those that are manually performed.
</div>

<div>
  • For example, a task analysis of a word processing system&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  would include tasks such as identifying the purpose and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  subject matter of a document, as well as automated tasks&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  such as typing, saving files, spell checking, etc.
</div>

<div>
  2. Surveys and Questionnaires
</div>

<div>
  • Surveys and questionnaires are useful for&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  collecting demographic and opinion data.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • They can help determine users&#8217; background and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  levels of subjective satisfaction.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Questions may be open-ended, fill-in-the-blank,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  multiple choice, or rating scales.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Questions should be carefully written so as not to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  lead users to the desired answer.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Data from questionnaires is relatively easy to&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  tabulate and analyze, but questionnaires usually&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  cannot provide in-depth information.
</div>

<div>
  3. Focus Groups and Interviews&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Focus groups and interviews are widely-used&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  informal techniques that can be useful for&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  planning or evaluating a system design.
</div>

<div>
  • A focus group involves a moderator questioning&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  a group of users.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • An interview is conducted one-on-one with an&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  individual user.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • These methods are valuable for questioning users&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  about their work or their opinion about a system.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Interviewers may ask users to describe a typical&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  day or task, why they do certain things, what they&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  would do when certain events occur, etc.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Interviews or focus groups may also include&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  asking users to evaluate simple sketches of a&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  system design.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • When analyzing data from focus groups and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  interviews, it is important to identify patterns of&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  responses and not to overemphasize any single&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  user&#8217;s comments.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • Like questionnaires, focus groups and interviews&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  collect self-reported data.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  • This may be problematic because users often do&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  not remember or accurately describe what they&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  do.&nbsp;
</div>
