<span style="font-family:Verdana;">WHAT IS</span> <u style="font-family:Verdana;"><span style="font-size:16pt;">AUDIT RISK MODEL?<br />Audit Risk (AR): risk that auditor will opine (render an opinion) with an unqualified opinion when unknown to auditor, FS are materially misstated (ultimate risk)</p> 

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Inherent Risk (IR): risk that errors (or misstatements or deviations) will occur,&#8221; client‑controlled
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Control Risk (CR): risk that client&#8217;s internal control system will fail to prevent/ detect/correct errors &#8230; client‑controlled
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Detection Risk (DRI_ risk that auditor&#8217;s procedures will fail to detect errors &#8230; auditor‑controlled
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  AR IR <strong>CR</strong> OR
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Audit risk = inherent risk <strong>control risk</strong> detection risk
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Audit risk: always set priority at a low level (.0 1, 05, 10)
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Inherent risk: controlled by client &#8230; function of type of business, degree of liquidity, complexity
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Control risk: controlled by client &#8230; relates to effectiveness of client&#8217;s control system in preventing, detecting, and correcting errors.
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Detection risk: controlled by auditor &#8230; function of nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures applied &#8230; allowable or acceptable
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Solution Set:
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detection risk = audit risk / (inherent risk <strong>control risk)</p> 
  
  <p>
    (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detection risk low &#8230; the more evidence you have to collect
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detection risk high &#8230; the less evidence you have to collect
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Audit Risk: risk that auditor issues unqualified opinion when statements are materially misstated, audit risk and detection risk exactly related.&nbsp; IR/CR and detection risk inversely related.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Mgmt Assertions:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; existence or occurrence
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completeness
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rights and obligations
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; valuation
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; presentation and disclosure
  </p>
  
  <p>
    </strong>auditor&#8217;s judgment about risks are based on assertions
  </p>
  
  <p>
    *assertions translated to account balances, then create audit objectives and procedures
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Inherent Risk Factors:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nature of activities (complexity)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regulatory nature
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; degree of estimates
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; competency and training of those reporting the financial statements
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; previous history with entity
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preliminary analysis testing ( req&#8217;d by SAS in planning)…indicates areas where misstatements occur
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Control Risk: SAS 78 requires auditor to document control risk assessment &#8230; if controls are not working, control risk is assessed at maximum
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Detection Risk: test of details and analytical procedures (ratios)&#8230; 1‑DR = confidence level&#8230; The detection risk cannot be lower than the audit risk (the highest of CR or IR):
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If CR is moderate or low, test must be designed to prove it
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IR &#8211; no implied tests, more efficient, doesn&#8217;t require tests, simply document assessment<br /></span></u>
