  <span data-offset-key="72cta-0-0">Directive functions all either have an agenda that wants to be pushed into reality (Worldview) or are meant to translate internal data into an objective and structured action (Dynamics). The Directive types are considered the most structured and schedule oriented, although different directive functions yield different manifestations of directivity. Directive types are action oriented, even when not directly taking action; they are mapping out what actions need to be taken. If we were to split Directive and Adaptive into the Yin and Yang, the directive types and function would be Yang, as directive functions are oriented toward creating an agenda, than pushing toward that agenda. Adaptive functions all either take in information as it is currently happening, or processing information that is occurring in the present. The adaptive functions harbour a person’s concept of present, and change as it is occurring now. These functions are all reactionary in that they “go with the flow” as opposed to directing the flow. The adaptive functions and adaptive types would be “yin”, in that are oriented toward moving with an agenda as opposed to pushing their own.</span>

<div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="6p8vt-0-0">
  <span data-offset-key="6p8vt-0-0">Directive types have a concern for where things are going; “is this going in a direction that I don’t want it to go in?” They set boundaries to direct others to move in certain directions, and avoid other ones. If personality type’s dominant and auxiliary functions are directive functions, then they are considered Directive (Or J) types. The Directive types must reach over to their right brain functions in order to adapt and freeform when they need to, although this is draining for them. Adaptive types have a curiosity for where things are going; “Is this going to go somewhere interesting?” They can be much more inviting and disarming in their pursuit of free formed and open ended flow of what is happening now. If personality type’s dominant and auxiliary functions are adaptive functions, then they are considered Adaptive (Or P) types. </span>
