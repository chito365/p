I have just come to believe on the words of philosopher Max Muller, &#8220;A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot live without love.&#8221; I now know how you feel me in your heart

I just wrote this blog post to recognize your presence that you are my mind all the time. I really miss something, and empty space in the heart. Everything i see is in blossom, and i&#8217;m happy really mixed with to recognize my joyous feelings love for you. I feel you approaching and i&#8217;m sorry if not responded. I will soon cross over and i&#8217;m pretty sure will meet.

This post is for you and you have come across it. Keep it Much love wherever you are!

:Me? I care too much. An incisive, inquisitive, insightful, irreverent mind you. I see someone for whom philosophical discussion is foreplay. I see someone who sometimes makes me go due to their wit and evil sense of humor. I look at someone that I can reach out and . I want someone I can with. I decided this all means that I am . Really awaiting for the moment!

I am Patient, visualizing daily into it.

Happy times, happy moments for you my ;-).

Good to see!
