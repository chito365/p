            <b class="whb">Try new things.</b> Novelty stimulates the brain, so being open to new experiences is important to boosting your intelligence. New experiences tend to increase neural activity in the brain, which can help improve intelligence over time.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference">[1]</sup>
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Be open in your day-to-day life. If a coworker invites you to see a band you&#8217;ve never heard, go. If you have an opportunity to take a trip to a place you&#8217;ve never been, take it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Build a new hobby or skill. Teach yourself to crochet. Enroll in an art class at a local community center. Start a sewing project.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spend time exposing yourself to new information as well. Read an article on a topic that interests you. Go to a museum. Watch a documentary.

            <b class="whb">Challenge yourself constantly.</b> Intelligent people do not settle. When you&#8217;ve mastered a particular skill, challenge yourself further. Keep pushing to the next level, as this will force your brain to work harder. This can expand your intelligence overall.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference">[2]</sup>
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Brains use a lot of energy during training. While you&#8217;re attempting to learn something, you are challenging your brain to make connections and learn new things. Once you&#8217;ve mastered a skill, this cognitive growth slows. In order to increase your intelligence, you should keep pushing yourself for a higher level of mastery.
            </li>
            <li>
              For example, say you play a musical instrument. You work hard for a few weeks to learn a new song, and eventually master it. Do not stop here. Challenge yourself by choosing a new, more difficult song. This will put your brain back into training mode, allowing for cognitive growth.

            <b class="whb">Eliminate certain conveniences.</b> While things like GPS and spellcheck are great conveniences, an over reliance on them means you&#8217;re not pushing yourself to build certain skills. Cutting out GPS for a few weeks can teach you how to find locations by logic and memory. Turning off the spellcheck function on your computer can help you think while you’re writing.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference">[3]</sup>
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              Try cutting shortcuts on occasion. There are times, of course, where it makes more sense to use a short cut. A paper you turn in for a grade in school, for example, should be spell checked carefully. However, you could stand to go without spell check when chatting online with a friend.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your brain needs exercise to grow. If you want to increase your intelligence, make efforts to challenge your brain during daily activities by eliminating conveniences and shortcuts. Think of this as the mental equivalent of taking the stairs instead of the elevator.
            </li>
            <li>
              For an extra brain boost, turn the spellcheck function back on after you have finished your document and use it to go through your document after you have caught everything you can. Then write down the words you didn’t catch so you can learn how to spell the words you missed. This will help you learn, which will help with giving your intelligence a boost.

            <b class="whb">Network with other people.</b> Learning through others is a great way to boost your intelligence. The smartest people are open to learning from those around them. Work on reaching out to other people and asking them for their input and thoughts on a variety of subjects.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference">[4]</sup>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Use social media to your advantage. Post an article on a scientific study and ask people for their thoughts. Chime in when you see a discussion occurring on a topical event on a Facebook thread. Take a sincere interest in other people&#8217;s responses and input.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to look for people outside your immediate field. If you work in tech, for example, go to a poetry reading and chat up the poet afterwards. You can learn a lot, and increase your overall intelligence, by learning about many different

              Instruments can be expensive, but you may be able to find cheap secondhand instruments online. See if you can find an instructor in your area who gives lessons. If that&#8217;s not within your budget, you may be able to find free or cheap lessons online.
            </li>
            <li>
              Get on a regular schedule. Incorporate practice into your daily routine, as you incorporate things like brushing your teeth and showering.

              You will challenge yourself more if you try to learn new challenging songs than if you play songs that you have already mastered.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference">[6]</sup> Try to work on learning new music all of the time in addition to your regular practice sessions.
