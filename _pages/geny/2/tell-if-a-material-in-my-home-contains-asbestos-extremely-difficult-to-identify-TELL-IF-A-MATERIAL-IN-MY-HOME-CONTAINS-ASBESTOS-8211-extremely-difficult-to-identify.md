It’s extremely difficult to identify asbestos just by looking at it, so you need to have **samples sent to a lab** **for testing.**

** **

It’s legal for homeowners to collect samples and have them tested, but it’s much safer for you and your family to **hire a trained [asbestos](https://www.afriqueunique.org/what-is-asbestos-find-more-in-depth-information-about-asbestos/)** **[professional](https://www.afriqueunique.org/what-is-asbestos-find-more-in-depth-information-about-asbestos/)** for the job.

&nbsp;

Search for “asbestos inspection” online or in the phone book to find a licensed expert. **The U.S. Department of Commerce** offers a <u>list of accredited</u> <u>asbestos laboratories </u>online.

HOW MUCH DOES ASBESTOS TESTING COST?

&nbsp;

You can hire a professional to inspect your home and collect samples, or you can do it yourself with a test kit from your local hardware store. The cost of asbestos testing varies depending on the **number of samples tested  and  the  methods  used.**

** **

The most popular testing method, **Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM)**, can range from $20 to $100 per sample. Some labs use **Transmission  Electron  Microscopy  (TEM)**, which is more expensive. DIY test kits require

you to mail samples to an accredited lab, which may charge an additional fee for analysis (typically around $40).

&nbsp;

Collecting samples yourself can create exposure risks, so hiring a **certified professional** is the safest choice for your and your family. The total cost of labor can run between $ 350 and

$600 &#8211; a small price to pay for peace of mind that the job will be completed safely.
