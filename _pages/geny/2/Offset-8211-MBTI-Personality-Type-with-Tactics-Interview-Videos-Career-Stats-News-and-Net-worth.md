After the lyric was understood as homophobic he apologized saying he did not intend for his use of the term &#8220;queer&#8221; to be directed at the LGBT community. His wife, Cardi B, said that Offset did not know the term &#8220;queer&#8221; had a homophobic history.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference">[18]</sup> Offset since has apologized for his controversial contribution of this lyric.

        When Migos first rose to prominence in 2013, Offset was incarcerated in Georgia&#8217;s Dekalb County jail for violating his probation that he had received due to prior felony convictions for burglary and theft.<sup id="cite_ref-RollingStone_1-4" class="reference">[1]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-gsu_25-0" class="reference">[25]</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On April 18, 2015, authorities stopped a Migos concert at Georgia Southern University and arrested all three members of the group, as well as several members of their entourage. Offset was denied bond and was charged with possession of an unspecified Schedule II narcotic, possession of marijuana, possession of a firearm in a school safety zone, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.<sup id="cite_ref-gsu_25-1" class="reference">[25]</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On May 2, 2015, Offset, while in custody, received additional charges of battery and inciting a riot within a penal facility after attacking another inmate, causing severe injury.<sup id="cite_ref-S'Boro_Herald_4_26-0" class="reference">[26]</sup> In a bond hearing before Bulloch County Superior Court Judge John R. Turner on May 8, 2015, Offset was formally denied bond based on his prior criminal record as well as the then-recent jail fight. During the hearing, two members of Migos&#8217; entourage were also denied bonds while four others were granted bonds and were barred from returning to Bulloch County as a condition of their release. Judge Turner directed the four who were released not to make contact with anyone involved in the case. Offset&#8217;s attorney argued that the rap trio were unfairly profiled by law enforcement and that officers had failed to prove ownership of the firearms and illicit drugs found within the two vans. The prosecution responded that law enforcement were present at the concert for the safety of the students and public at-large due to Migos&#8217; history of violence. Upon hearing the decision, Offset shouted obscenities as he was escorted out of the courtroom.<sup id="cite_ref-S'boro_Herald_5_27-0" class="reference">[27]</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After eight months in custody, Offset was released on December 4, 2015, after accepting an Alford plea deal. The deal dropped the gun, drug, and gang-related charges in exchange for pleading guilty to inciting a riot within a penal facility, paying a $1,000 fine, serving five years probation, and being banished from Bulloch, Effingham, Jenkins, and ScrevenCounties.<sup id="cite_ref-WSB-TV_Plea_28-0" class="reference">[28]</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On March 17, 2016, Offset was arrested for driving with a suspended license but was released the next day without having charges filed.<sup id="cite_ref-2016_arrest_29-0" class="reference">[29]</sup>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Additionally, on April 5, 2018, Migos&#8217; tour bus was pulled over on a traffic violation in North Carolina. Officers searched their tour bus and found 420 grams of marijuana, 26 ounces of codeine and Xanax. The group members were not arrested, Offset was not in attendance, but members of their entourage were.</dt> </dl>
