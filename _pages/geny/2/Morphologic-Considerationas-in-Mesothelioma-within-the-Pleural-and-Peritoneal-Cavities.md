  * Present and describe the histologic subtypes

&nbsp;

  * Discuss the reproducibility and impact on prognosis of histologic subtypes
  * Based on a 1994 workshop by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), a staging system for pleural mesothelioma was instituted in the 6th(2006) and 7th (2010) AJCC system
  * Validation of staging system was studied in 2012 
      * 3101 patients were studied
      * No evidence based recommendations could be made based on a lack of granular data
      * 15 centers

  * Follow-up group from 29 centers was attempted to analyze the staging system
  * 2460 patients were able to be analyzed
  * 827 patients had pre-treatment info; 830 had post surgical data; 803 had both data elements
  * Limited ability to influence staging parameters
  * Biphasic (at least 10% of either element)
  * Sarcomatoid
  * Desmoplastic

&nbsp;

  * Distinguishing malignant vs benign

&nbsp;

  * Distinguishing metastasis vs mesothelioma

&nbsp;

  * Limited work separating out prognosis based on morphologic features

&nbsp;

Pathologic parameters

(choose one option then delete the other option and delete this line)

  * Depth of invasion: Superficially invasive (≤0.5 mm) / Deeply invasive (>0.5mm)
  * Prominent desmoplasia: Yes / No
  * Mitotic count: ≤5/50 hpf / >5/50hpf
  * Nuclear grade: Low / High
  * Lymph node metastases: Yes / No
  * Sarcomatoid component: Yes / No

(Assessment of _CDKN2A_/p16 and _NF2_ by FISH, and BAP1 and PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry are pending; the results will follow in an addendum)

  * Acinar
  * Adenomatoid

# *       Micropapillary

  * **Solid**
  * **Tubulopapillary**
  * **Trabecular**

  * **Tubulopapillary**
  * **Micropapillary**
  * **Trabecular**
  * **Solid**
  * Pleomorphic
  * Papillary
  * Tubular

&nbsp;

  * Definitions of papillary lesions have overlapping descriptions
  * “Pure” Epithelioid Patterns rarely observed (19% in one study)
  * Most frequently (41%) observe three epithelioid morphologies
  * Solid subtype was most reproducible among four reviewers
  * Mitotic index (>5/50 per high power field) associated with a poor survival
  * 63 yo male who presented with abdominal pain and shortness of breath
  * Diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma
  * Treated with cisplatin and Alimta
  * Grade of lymphocytic host response 
      * None-mild
      * Moderate
      * Severe
  * May be relevant; reproducibility studies need to be performed/Image analysis
  * Epithelioid subtype mesothelioma frequently shows multiple morphologic patterns
  * Some morphologic patterns are associated with a lower survival
  * Lack of reproducibility and low case series to evaluate limit the ability to study the significance of epithelioid subtype morphology
  * Changing treatment paradigms will further complicate the assessment of epithelioid subtypes
