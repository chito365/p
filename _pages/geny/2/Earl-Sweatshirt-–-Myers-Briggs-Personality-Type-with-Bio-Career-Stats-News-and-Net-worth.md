    His work (as well as the work of his fellow OFWGKTA members) is noted for its often obscene content. His music has been well received online by some music websites, and his group has recently been featured in mainstream magazines such as The New Yorker, Thrasher, Spin, and Billboard as well as appearing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and completing a mini-tour of the American east coast. His debut studio album, Earl, was released March 31, 2010 as a free digital download on the OFWGKTA website.Earl was named the 24th best album of 2010 by Complex.

    Various sources indicate that Earl is not currently making music with OFWGKTA. Recent posts from Tyler the Creator&#8217;s Twitter and Formspring seem to indicate that Earl&#8217;s mother will not grant permission to release any of Earl&#8217;s music.
