The death of an old man is like the loss Of a library. RIP Ndungu wa Gicheru who was laid to rest yesterday. The Mau Mau immortalized him in the words of the song that went &#8220;ndungu mwanake wa gicheru niwe wa harurukagia tutege tukute kunyarira itungati&#8221; &#8230; Ndunguson of Gicheru is the one whoused to shoot down the planes that had come to terrorize the people. Soon there will be non left to to tell us the story of our past because we prefer useless political rhetoric.
