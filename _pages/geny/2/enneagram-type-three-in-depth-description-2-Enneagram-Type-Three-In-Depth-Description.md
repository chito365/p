Common Descriptive Names: (1) The Achiever, (2) The Performer, (3) The Motivator  
Unconscious Fear for type Three: Of being worthless (apart from their achievements)  
To compensate for their Unconscious Fear an Unconscious Desire arises&#8230;..  
Unconscious Desire for type Three: To be valuable and desirable (as measured by the favorable  
responses they receive from others)

As our personality was forming in early childhood we each developed limiting subconscious beliefs  
about ourselves, others and the world. For example, your mother or father might have yelled at you  
“Get your hands out of there!” or “You should be ashamed of yourself!” or “Stop being such a cry  
baby!” If you had really loving parents you might have heard, “Don’t touch that, it’s hot!” or “Don’t do  
that, you might hurt yourself!” We also developed limiting beliefs about others. Growing up you may  
have heard, “I don’t want you to play with those kinds of kids” or “Salesmen are sleazebags” or  
“Politicians are so duplicitous and two-faced.” We also developed limiting beliefs about the world.  
Newspapers and television constantly bombard our minds with reports of scandals, crimes, wars,  
economic crises, natural disasters, and political corruption. Does this help us believe the world is a  
loving, safe place to live? Of course not. One way or another, none of us escaped childhood without  
some limiting subconscious beliefs. Your Enneagram type identifies some of the strongest  
subconscious beliefs that you’ve developed over time based on your distorted perception of reality.

**Limiting Subconscious Beliefs for type Three:**

• My worth depends on my achievements.  
• True feelings are not to be expressed if they make you look bad.  
• My value is dependent on the positive regard of others.  
• It’s important to present a winning image.  
• It’s up to me to “make it” in life.  
• To be loved I must be successful, a winner.
