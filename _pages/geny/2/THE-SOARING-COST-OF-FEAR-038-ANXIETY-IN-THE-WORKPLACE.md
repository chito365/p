While leaders work hard to not show that they are  
afraid or overwhelmed, employees bond together and  
talk about how “stressed” they are and how stressful  
the workload is. It’s much more acceptable to feel  
“nervous” or “stressed” than to admit one is afraid.  
These words have become a catchall for various fears  
that remain unnamed. Anxiety disorders are the most  
common mental illness in Canada with 2 in 3 sufferers  
being women (Public Health Agency of Canada, The  
human face of mental health and mental illness in  
Canada). Individuals with anxiety disorders experience  
greater functional disability than individuals with  
common physical disorders (i.e. arthritis, high blood  
pressure). The human and economic costs of anxiety  
disorders in the workplace are profound. Anxiety  
among the employed is linked with both absenteeism  
and diminished productivity (presenteeism). When  
you take into account the direct costs of anxiety in  
terms of medication, physician visits, the indirect  
costs, such as decreased productivity, and the  
intangible costs (e.g. pressure on the remaining  
employees who have to make up for the productivity  
lost by the person with anxiety), the total cost of  
anxiety is enormous. Estimates in Canada place it as  
high as $35 billion dollars. (Health Canada. Assessing the  
Costs of Workplace Stress). Still, no one is talking about  
fear as the root cause of this phenomenal loss of human  
productivity and how to identify and address underlying  
fears in employees.&nbsp;
