The breast is mostly made up of different tissue, ranging from very fatty tissue to very dense tissue. Within this tissue is  a network of lobes, which are made up of small, tube-like structures called lobules that contain milk glands. Tiny ducts

connect the glands, lobules, and lobes, carrying the milk from the lobes to the nipple. The nipple is located in the middle of the areola, which is the darker area that surrounds the nipple. Blood and lymph vessels also run throughout the breast. Blood nourishes the cells, and the lymphatic system drains bodily waste products. The lymph vessels connect to lymph nodes, which are tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection.

#### Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women (excluding skin cancer), but men

can also be diagnosed.

Breast cancer begins when healthy cells in the breast change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor can grow but does not spread to other parts of the body, and it is rarely life-threatening.

&nbsp;

Breast cancer can be invasive or noninvasive. Invasive breast cancer is cancer that spreads into surrounding tissues. Noninvasive breast cancer does not go beyond the milk ducts or lobules in the breast. Most breast cancers start in the ducts, called ductal carcinoma, or in the lobules, called lobular carcinoma. A pathologist determines whether a tumor removed during a biopsy is ductal or lobular cancer. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and evaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease.

&nbsp;

If the disease has spread outside the duct or lobule and into the surrounding tissue, it is called invasive or infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma. Cancer that is located only in the duct or lobule is called in situ, meaning “in place,” and

is noninvasive. Most in situ breast cancers are ductal [carcinoma](https://www.afriqueunique.org/carcinoma-type-of-cancer-explained/) in situ (DCIS). DCIS is often treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy (see “Breast Cancer Treatment,” p. 14). Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is not

considered cancer and is usually monitored by a doctor with regularly scheduled examinations and imaging tests. LCIS in one breast is a risk factor for developing invasive breast cancer in both breasts. To reduce this risk, LCIS is sometimes treated with hormonal therapy.

&nbsp;

Other less common types of breast cancer include medullary, mucinous, tubular, metaplastic, and papillary breast cancer, as well as other even rarer types. Inflammatory breast cancer is a faster growing type of cancer that accounts for about 1% to 5% of all breast cancers. At first it may be misdiagnosed as a breast infection because there is often swelling of the breast and redness of the breast skin that starts suddenly, and there may be no breast mass or lump. Paget’s disease is a type of cancer that begins in the ducts of the nipple. The skin often appears scaly and may be itchy. Although it is usually in situ, it can also be an invasive cancer.

As a cancerous breast tumor grows, cancer cells may break away and be carried to other parts of the body through

the bloodstream or lymphatic system. During this process, known as metastasis, the cancer cells can grow and develop in new locations in the body. One of the first places breast cancer usually spreads is to the regional lymph nodes located under the arm, in the neck, under the chest bone, or just above the collarbone.

&nbsp;

[Breast cancer can also spread farther](https://www.afriqueunique.org/different-types-of-breast-cancer-tumors-and-how-to-deal-with-each-according-to-therapists/) away from the breast  to other parts of the body, such as the bones, lungs, and  liver. Less often, breast cancer may spread to the brain. Breast cancer that has spread to a distant location in the body is referred to as stage IV or metastatic breast cancer. However, even if the cancer has spread, it is still named for the area where it began. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the

lungs, it is called metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer. No matter whether the cancer has spread or how far it has spread, breast cancer can be treated and/or managed.

Although most women who develop breast cancer have no known risk factors and no family history of breast

cancer, about 5% to 10% of breast cancers occur when gene changes, called mutations, are passed down in a family  from one generation to the next. Breast cancer may run in

a family if other close relatives have been diagnosed with breast, ovarian, or other cancers, especially before age 50. If 2 first-degree relatives developed breast cancer, the risk is 5 times the average risk.

&nbsp;

There are several genes linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, but 2 of the most common are _breast_ _ cancer genes 1_ and _2._ These are commonly shortened to _BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_. A mutation in either of these genes gives a woman an increased risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer, as well as other types of cancer. Men who inherit these gene mutations also have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, as well as prostate cancer.

&nbsp;

Other gene mutations or hereditary conditions can increase a person’s risk of breast cancer. They are far less common than _BRCA1_ or _BRCA2,_ and they do not increase the risk of breast cancer as much:

  * Lynch syndrome, associated with the _MLH1_ and

_M__S__H2_ genes

&nbsp;

NOTES:

&nbsp;

  * Cowden syndrome (CS), associated with the _PTEN_ gene
  * Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), associated with the _TP53_

and _CH__EK__2_ genes

  * Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), associated with the

_S__TK11_ gene

  * Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), associated with the _AT__M_ gene
  * Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, associated with the

_CDH1_ gene

  * _PALB2_ gene

&nbsp;

Genetic testing is available to check for known mutations in these genes. Your doctor may recommend a test called a panel test, which looks for mutations in several different

genes at the same time. But this testing is not recommended for everyone. It is only recommended after a person has received appropriate genetic counseling.
