SometimesÂ  you get to view the warm dream within you.

You feel the spirits go high.

Leave alone the forced ones.

I mean you feel the warmth all over your body .

What you do appears like what is done in the second world war.

Oprah, leave alone the name.

I have felt the warm hand greet me.

Mother! More than inspiration to me.

I get the role to play, as a man, you got to do extraordinary towards making this world a better place.

I know Maya, Maya is listening.

You are watching over us.

The dream is getting so high.

Open the skies and let us get all from you.

Nothing will stop me.

My deep breath is a sigh of relief.

I see the works i have got to accomplish.

You, Stop it, Stop it Now! ðŸ˜€

Something is burning so high. ðŸ™‚
