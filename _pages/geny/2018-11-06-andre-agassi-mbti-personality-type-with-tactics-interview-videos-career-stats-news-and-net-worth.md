>           Born in 1970, Andre Agassi won several USTA junior national titles before turning professional at the age of 16. In 1992, Agassi won his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon. More victories soon followed with a U.S. Open win in 1994 and the Australian Open in 1995. After a career slump, Agassi returned to top form in 1999 with wins at the U.S. Open and French Open. He retired from competition in 2006.

>           For 20 years, tennis legend Andre Agassi was one of the dominant players in his sport. He first picked up a racket when he was a toddler at the insistence of his father. His father, an immigrant from Iran and a former Olympic boxer, served as his first coach, making Agassi practice for hours at the family&#8217;s Las Vegas, Nevada home.

>           In his mid-teens, Agassi abandoned his education to train full time. He moved to Florida where he went to the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy. Agassi proved to be one of the top junior players in the sport, winning several U.S. Tennis Association national titles. At the age of sixteen, Agassi decided it was time to compete in the big leagues. The young tennis player turned professional in 1986.

>           When he first arrived on the tennis scene, Agassi turned heads and raised eyebrows with his wild hair and bright clothing. The boisterous athlete quickly had an endorsement deal with Nike before even winning a title. Some wondered whether there was any substance behind of his youthful good looks and flashy style. While Agassi won his first competition in 1987, but he failed to clinch a major title during his early career. In 1992, Agassi silenced his critics with a win at Wimbledon, his first Grand Slam title.

>           After his Wimbledon win, Agassi had several more Grand Slam victories in the early 1990s. He took the top spot at the U.S. Open in 1994. He was victorious at the Australian Open in 1995, which helped him climb to the top of rankings that year. Clearly at the top of his game, Agassi won a gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, Georgia. Off the court, charismatic Agassi&#8217;s personal life became a popular topic in the tabloids. He was romantically linked to singer Barbra Streisand before marrying actress Brooke Shields in 1997.
