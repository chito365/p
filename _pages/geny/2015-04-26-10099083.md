**Predictive (Designs)  
created up-front, before implementation starts  
predict how the software will be like  
helpful for resource planning and risk assessment  
**Extracted**  
extracted from an existing system, by analysis of the properties of the software  
help answer specific questions about the software</p> 

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Prescriptive</span></strong>  
correspond to an existing system and its code  
set of rules on how to evolve the software  
software engineers must guarantee that the models remain valid after they change the code  
define constraints that need to be preserved during evolution
