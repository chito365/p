<span style="font-family:Verdana;">A good first thought for making counters that can count higher is to chain Divide-by-2 counters together. We can feed the Q out of one flop into the CLK of the next stage. The result looks something like this:</span>

</p>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">The ripple counter is easy to understand. Each stage acts as a Divide-by-2 counter on the previous stage&#8217;s signal. The Q out of each stage acts as both an output bit, and as the clock signal for the next stage.</span>

</p>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">We can chain as many ripple counters together as we like. A three bit ripple counter will count 2<sup>3</sup>=8 numbers, and an n-bit ripple counter will cound 2<sup>n</sup> numbers.</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">The problem with ripple counters is that each new stage put on the counter adds a delay. This propagation delay is seen when we look at a less idealized timing diagram:</span>

</p>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Now we can see that the propagation delay does not only slow down the counter, but it actually introduces errors into the system. These errors increase as we add additional stages to the ripple counter.<br /></span>
