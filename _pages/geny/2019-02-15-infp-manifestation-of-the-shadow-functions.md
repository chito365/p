When Introverted Sensing takes over, the INFP’s functions work in reverse order—Te dictates Fi, rather than the other way around, and Si feeds into Ne. Their reversed function stacking makes them resemble their dichotomous four- letter opposite, the ESTJ. However, the INFP’s under-exercised Te does not function with the precision and capability that the ESTJ’s dominant Te does— they will therefore behave as an unhealthy or imbalanced ESTJ.

The INFP in the grip of their inferior function becomes a harsh critic of the world around them. Accidentally rebelling against their idealistic nature, this type sees only the incompetence and disorder in the world around them. The normally generous and flexible INFP becomes rigid, judgmental and argumentative. They are quick to perceive others’ flaws and may become uncharacteristically harsh judges of character (Quenk, 2002).

The longer their grip state endures for, the more the INFP turns their critical judgments inward—berating themselves for a host of perceived inadequacies. They may quickly trust in their own abilities—feeling as though they’re ill equipped to make even small-scale decisions about their lives. In the face of large-scale decisions, they are likely to find themselves paralyzed (Quenk, 2002).

This type may also become paranoid about others’ perceptions of them during a grip experience—believing that everyone around them is judging them as incompetent and foolish (Quenk, 2002). A coworker commenting that the INFP missed a task is interpreted by the INFP as, “My co-worker thinks I’m an idiot who can’t do anything right.” A family member calling the INFP’s artwork ‘interesting’ is interpreted as, “They think my work is unoriginal and they don’t believe I’ll make it as an artist.”

Genuinely believing that others hold negative perceptions of them, the INFP may attempt to take corrective actions, which end up seeming out of place. They may snap at a family member, “I know you don’t believe in my art,” or apologize profusely to their boss for their poor work performance—when in reality their boss may not think they were performing poorly at all!

The INFP may overcompensate for his or her perceived inadequacies by trying to come across as incredibly logical at all times. They are likely to consciously reject introverted feeling’s input and become hyper-focused on getting their facts straight on any topic they may be called upon to discuss and ensuring that they present themselves as organized and ‘together’ to others.

While this behavior would be perfectly healthy in an ESTJ type, it is the

&nbsp;

difference in motivation between the gripping INFP and the healthy ESTJ that sets the scenario apart. Whereas the ESTJ’s extroverted thinking is genuinely seeking to instill order, the gripping INFP’s extroverted thinking is seeking only to protect his or her ego. The INFP is, in a sense, rejecting him or herself before others have the chance to do so.

If the INFP criticizes their own work and deems themselves a failure, they don’t have to bear the harsh sting of rejection that may come from putting their work out there and having it criticized by others. If the INFP deems themselves incapable of making big decisions, it saves them from making the wrong one and having to deal with the consequences. If the INFP predicts every pitfall and criticism that might come their way before they actually encounter it, they don’t have to worry about being caught off-guard by any sort of emotional pain. And so the INFP becomes his or her own worst enemy, before anybody else gets the chance to.

If introverted feeling is a river, a Te grip is the equivalent of the INFP building dams around every edge of the river, until the water becomes entirely trapped inside. Nothing can enter that will further pollute the river, but the water also ceases to flow. It ceases to integrate. Introverted feeling lies polluted and dormant inside of Te’s walls, where it is safe but also wholly ineffective.

To outsiders, the INFP may seem to have lost the very essence of who they are, as their compassionate and creative personalities have been replaced with a strict, almost militant version of themselves.

### INFP Account: Shadow Functions Activate

_“In_ _the winter that followed my divorce (leading up to its one-year anniversary that April), it seemed like I could truly do no right._

_For_ _starters,_ _I had never experienced such an intense creative block with my writing. It was as though my mind was rejecting everything I could invent before I even sat down to write it. Everything I thought of immediately seemed too cliché or trite to make it to publication. I felt immensely frustrated by my own lack of creativity. For many months, I wrote nothing at all._

&nbsp;

_Putting_ _myself back out there in the dating scene proved to be an even bigger challenge than recovering my writing. I wanted desperately to move on with someone new, but I could never bring myself to go on dates. I fell into a continuous cycle of chatting men up online, setting up a time and place to meet them and then canceling the date the morning of. I would always think of some reason why they wouldn’t like me—one day it would be_

_t__hat I don’t make enough money, the next day it would be my big nose. It was as though I was constantly staring into a mirror that showed only my biggest insecurities. And I didn’t want to give anyone the chance to prove me right about myself. To be honest, I’m not sure I could’ve handled a rejection at that point in my life._

_Everything_ _I did that winter felt wrong. I did a miserable job at substitute teaching because my heart just wasn’t in it. I applied for a few full-time positions but nothing came to fruition—of the two interviews I attended, one I botched horribly and the other was offered to me but it would have required a cross-country move. I couldn’t imagine uprooting myself at that time. In another life I’d have welcomed the change but at that time I wanted desperately to cling to whatever scraps of familiarity I had left._

_Being able to support myself was the one point of pride that kept me afloat at that time. My mother—who’d divorced my biological father twenty years prior—kept urging me to come stay with her while I sorted thing out but I was mortified by the thought. I couldn’t imagine what others would think of me if I were to move back home at my age. Even though a part of me secretly ached for my mother’s support, I was too proud to accept her offer._

_I felt certain that everyone was monitoring and judging me as harshly as I was judging myself. At one point, I remember blurting out to my best friend, “I know you think I’m pathetic for still missing (my ex-husband).” I was completely taken aback when she responded, “I don’t think that at all._

_Getting_ _over someone takes a long time.” In my mind, I’d been certain she was judging me for still being hung up on my divorce. In reality, she felt nothing but compassion for me. If all that wasn’t enough, I hung up the phone and immediately started beating myself up over holding such negative assumptions about my friend._

&nbsp;

_I__t truly felt as though I couldn’t do anything right at that time—I was my own worst enemy and I can see now that I was denying myself the exact care and compassion I needed in order to heal.”_
