<strong>Mauricio Pochettino was appointed as Tottenham Hotspur head coach in May 2014 and has since signed a new deal to keep him at the club until 2021.</strong>

The former Argentina defender made more than 300 appearances for Espanyol before hanging up his boots in 2006 after winning his second Copa del Rey title with the Barcelona-based side at the age of 34.

Pochettino first moved to Espanyol at the start of the 1994/95 season, having learnt his trade at Newell’s Old Boys in Argentina.

He joined Paris Saint-Germain in 2001 and also enjoyed a spell at Bordeaux before returning to Espanyol in 2004, before moving into the coaching system at the Spanish club.

The Argentine took over as manager of Espanyol in January 2009 with the club third from bottom in La Liga and guided them to a 10th-place finish.

In the following season, the Spanish club finished 11th and then narrowly missed out on a UEFA Europa League spot in the 2010/11 campaign, ending up in eighth position.

He left the club a few months in to the 2012/13 campaign before&nbsp;accepting&nbsp;his first job in the Premier League in Janaury 2013.

His debut season with Southampton&nbsp;included impressive wins over reigning Premier League champions Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea.

The following campaign proved even more successful and, at the time, it saw Pochettino guide the Saints&nbsp;to their highest ever finish in the Premier League.

Pochettino was then chosen by&nbsp;Spurs&nbsp;as Tim Sherwood’s replacement for the 2014/15 season.&nbsp;

A fifth-place finish would follow in his first term at Spurs, but it was the 2015/16 campaign which saw the Argentine enjoy his best season in England.

After pushing eventual champions Leicester City for the majority of the campaign, his side finished in third place to return to the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 2010/11.&nbsp;

His achievements earned a new five-year deal in May 2016 as Pochettino’s official title switched from head coach to manager ahead of Season 2016/17.</pre></section>

Any thoughts about other ones? I've got my thoughts, but I'm not really sure of them, so I think I'll wait for other theories about further managers (and players).
