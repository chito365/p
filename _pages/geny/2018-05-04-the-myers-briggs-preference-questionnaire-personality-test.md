THE MYERS-BRIGGS PREFERENCE  
QUESTIONNAIRE (Personality Test)  
• This is a 20 question questionnaire designed to help see who  
you are.  
• Self-evaluating is not foolproof.  
• Even when test-takers answer honestly, there are reasons why  
the score is different from their true type.  
• Taking this questionnaire is one step to determine your  
personality type.  
• Consider the results with objectivity and caution.  
1  
MYERS-BRIGGS Directions:  
• For each of the following 20 prompts choose a. or b.  
• Record your answers on the score sheet directly below question  
• The score sheet runs horizontally along the row before going down  
• Choose the answer that you think most accurately describes you  
• Even if you agree with both answers, check one you agree with more.  
• Answer as you really are, not you want to be.  
• Make choices for the majority of your life situations.  
• Having strong interests should not be used to cloud the results.  
• Think of situations in which you are free to be yourself.  
• There are no right or wrong answers.  
• Answer honestly.

MYERS-BRIGGS Explanation  
• The original ideas of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) were  
created by Carl Gustav Jung in 1921.  
• The actual test was officially published in 1962. The test was created  
to help determine which careers would be best for women as they  
entered the workforce for the first time during WWII.  
• It is a psychological analysis examination that determines a person’s  
psychological makeup and how they perceive and make decisions.  
The test is made of four different dichotomies or personality  
descriptions. One can either be:  
1. Introverted or Extroverted  
2. Sensing or Intuitive  
3. Thinking or Feeling  
4. Judging or Perceptive
