  Life should go on and on.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  The system should move on since we do not know how it acts.
</div>

<div>
  we do not know who is in control.
</div>

<div>
  One acts innocently with or without informed knowing.
</div>

<div>
   He or she as human can impact another human greatly.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  There are so many theories to support and many to go against.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Parallel system is not recommended though. We are one family.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  No one is an island.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  For now, thank you, thank you for the part i have played and the part you have played.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Everything nice,
</div>

<div>
  Everything is smooth.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  This is not awakening thought,
</div>

<div>
  but a self thought.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Every human has, has it original.
</div>

<div>
  Turn your world on!
</div>

  Call you spirits!
</div>

  You are not fool!
