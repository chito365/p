Here is my little advice to you brothers and sisters. Check to make sure that your hobby is something that you want to do and think about every day. When you do something once a month or once a week it stays fresh and provides you with something to look forward to. In contrast, when you have to work in it every day you may have to find something else to replace it. Wake up every morning seeing that your dream is going to be fulfilled. Bless!
