<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><b>Logical-Intuitive Intratim &#8211; INTj (The Analyst)</b>&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><i>Based upon original work by Victor Gulenko with some alterations</i>&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><a class="active-text" title="More about INTjs" href="https://www.afriqueunique.org/?s=INTJ">INTjs<img src="http://www.socionics.com/prof/common/graph/q-mark.gif" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;have a characteristic ascetic face. There are two reason for this. Firstly the facial structure itself is often reminiscent of ancient portraits because of its angularity and composition of the features, like cheekbone and eyebrow arcs. Secondly their facial expression is often accepted as emotionless and severe. Their face is usually pale or bloodless. Males often have a short haircut.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">In many cases INTjs are slim. Their stomach is usually placed ahead of the chest giving them their characteristic posture. Their gait is somewhat unsure, wavering slightly. Sometimes it seems like they are not sure where they are going. This becomes more obvious in moments of excitement. Their clothes are not usually very striking. INTjs do not like to attract excessive attention to themselves and most of the time they stick to simple clothes, often wearing the same style and composition for a long time.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">INTjs behave in a very self-restrained manner with strangers, never showing initiative first and always maintaining a long psychological distance. Their speech is very clear and logical and they always follow a logical progression. They also have a tendency to emphasise key words. When defending their concepts and ideas during a confrontation their logic can become solid and absolute. They cut out all irrelevant details that may cloud the argument.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Although the first impression of INTjs is that they are emotionless, when they become inspired during conversation an emotionality previously unseen begins to emerge. Their eyes start flashing with a fanatic light and their passion increases as the conversation progresses. However, they still try to maintain their self-control. INTjs sustain conversations only if they find them interesting. They prefer to keep silent rather than give an opinion on a subject to which they are indifferent.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">INTjs always give others a chance to say what they need to say. They consider that everyone has got talents and they try at least not to interfere. They do not refuse any proposals immediately, preferring to examine them first. INTjs are very reserved and usually do not take the initiative in talking about their interests and private life. This can lead others to think that they have no private life at all.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">INTjs have a very characteristic tendency to independence and can only accept a whole freedom. In work matters they combine their need for freedom with a feeling of responsibility. INTjs are not very demanding. They are often indifferent to food and its presentation. It can be simple but must be fresh. When involved in something interesting they can completely forget that they need to eat. In everyday matters INTjs are modest and are happy to have a minimum degree of comfort.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">INTjs usually have an interest that stays with them for a long time and are absolutely indifferent to what others say about it. They never endorse their position in life. INTjs live in a world of their own conception. They simply ignore rules, concepts and directives that do not suit them. Most people do not understand INTjs and try to keep away from them.&nbsp;</span>
