&#8211; Highly analytical, they can discover connections between two seemingly unrelated things, and work best  
when allowed to use their imagination and critical thinking.

1. **Physicists**

&nbsp;

Physicists typically specialize in one of many subfields, and some will go further to specialize in a subdivision of one of these subfields. However, all [physics](https://www.sokanu.com/degrees/physics/) involve the same fundamental principles.

**Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics**  
&#8211; is research on atoms, simple molecules, electrons and light, and their interactions

**Astrophysics**  
&#8211; is the study of physical processes in stars and other galactic sources, galactic structure and evolution, the early [history](https://www.sokanu.com/degrees/history/) and evolution of the universe, and the sun and solar activity

**Biological Physics**  
&#8211; is the study of biological phenomena using physical techniques

**Chemical Physics**  
&#8211; provides understanding for a broad range of systems, from atomic collisions to complex materials, as well as the behaviour of the individual atoms and particles that make up the system

**Computational Physics**  
&#8211; explores the use of computers in physics research and education, as well as the role of physics in the development of computer technology

**Condensed Matter Physics**  
&#8211; concentrates on such topics as superconductivity, semi-conductors, magnetism, complex fluids, and thin films

**Fluid Dynamics**  
&#8211; is the study of the physics of fluids with special emphasis on the dynamical theories of the liquid, plastic and gaseous states of matter under all conditions of temperature and pressure

**Laser Science**  
&#8211; or laser physics is a branch of optics that describes the theory and practice of lasers

**Materials Physics**  
&#8211; applies physics to complex and multiphase media including materials of technological interest, and uses physics to describe materials in many different ways such as force, heat, light and mechanics

**Nuclear Physics**  
&#8211; is the study of fundamental problems related to the nature of matter

**Particles and Fields**  
&#8211; is the study of particles and fields, their interrelationships, interactions and structure, and the design and development of accelerators and instrumentation techniques for high energy physics

**Physics of Beams**  
&#8211; is the study of the nature and behaviour of beams and the instruments for their production and use

**Plasma Physics**  
&#8211; plasma, solid, gas and liquid are the four states of matter. Plasma physics is the study of plasma charged particles and fluids interacting with electric and magnetic fields.

**Polymer Physics**  
&#8211; focuses on the physics of natural and synthetic macromolecular substances
