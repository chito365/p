<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Advantages of simulation packages<br />Provide most modeling features, so “programming” effort, cost is reduced, often significantly<br />Natural framework for simulation modeling<br />Usually make it easier to modify models<br />Better error detection for simulation-specific errors<br />Advantages of general-purpose programming languages<br />More widely known, available<br />Usually executes faster … if well written<br />May allow more modeling flexibility<br />Software cost is usually lower</p>
