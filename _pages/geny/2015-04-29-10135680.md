Options:

1.Use C++. There is quite a steep learning curve, because, not only do we have to learn C++ (the easy part!) we also have to understand the OpenGL library (GLUT) or Direct3d and any other libraries you may need.

2.Use Java and Java3D &#8211; Much easier to learn, this is what I use, JBuilder6 is for Java, however the downside of this is that Java can run slower and it is more difficult to distribute Java applications to other people. There is a standard extension to Java which supports 3D display, this is Java3D.

3..Net languages such as C# or Visual Basic which (2003 versions/ net1.1) now support directX 9.
