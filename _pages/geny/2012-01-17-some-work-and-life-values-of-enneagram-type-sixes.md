## As a Six, career satisfaction means doing work that&#8230;..

1. Allows me to work with other conscientious, reliable, trustworthy, hardworking people as part  
of a collaborative team or on my own with a minimum of stress and competition.  
2. Allows me to work with a boss who is patient, supportive, dependable, predictable and doesn’t  
take advantage of my loyalty, dedication and hard-work ethic by asking me to work overtime  
too much (so that I can have a personal life). Or, allows me to work for myself with no  
authority to worry about.  
3. Offers clearly defined structure and guidelines to follow as well as a clear hierarchy of  
authority (if not self-employed).  
4. Allows me time to do good, detail-oriented work at my own pace without pressuring me to  
make instantaneous decisions or work under pressure to tight deadlines.  
5. Makes use of my innate ability to foresee potential problems before they arise. I am a natural  
troubleshooter.  
6. Offers job security and stability.  
7. Allows me to protect, serve, support or ensure the safety of others in some capacity.  
8. Makes use of my aptitude for research, investigation and detailed analysis. In short, any field  
that involves digging beneath the surface to uncover the hidden elements I’m good at.  
9. Allows me to work carefully and methodically. I like to plan, organize and stay on top of  
things.  
10. Rewards healthy questioning and skepticism as well as an inquiring mind
