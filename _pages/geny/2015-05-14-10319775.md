A Trojan horse, or Trojan, in computing is generally a non-self-replicating type of malware program containing malicious code that, when executed, carries out actions determined by the nature of the Trojan, typically causing loss or theft of data, and possible system harm. The term is derived from the Ancient Greekstory of wooden horseused to trick defenders of Troyinto taking concealed warriors into their city in ancient Anatolia, because computer Trojans often employ a form of social engineering, presenting themselves as routine, useful, or interesting in order to persuade victims to install them on their computers. A Trojan often acts as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer.
