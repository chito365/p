  1. Feed Your Strengths! You have been given the great ability to create logical, ethical principles that transcend personal Allow these principles to be as good as they can be by creating them with consideration for all available data.
  2. Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to overcome Especially, resist the tendency to judge too quickly, and remember the importance of considering other people&#8217;s feelings.
  3. Talk Through the Facts or write them You need to step through the facts in order to define good principles to live by. Verbalizing them or putting them down on paper may be a valuable tool for you.
  4. Take in Don&#8217;t dismiss ideas prematurely because you think you already know the answer. Seek first to understand, and then to be understood.
  5. When You Get Angry, You Your passion for your principles is admirable, but becomes destructive when you fall into the &#8220;Anger Trap.&#8221; Remember that Anger is destructive to personal relationships, and can be extremely hurtful to others. Work through your anger before you unleash it upon others. Disagreements and disappointments can only be handled effectively in a non- personal and dispassionate manner.
  6. Be Yourself in Relationships Don&#8217;t expect yourself to be a &#8220;touchy-feely&#8221; or &#8220;warm fuzzy&#8221; Realize that your most ardent bonds start with the head, rather than the heart. You expect your actions to speak for themselves to your loved ones. This may not be enough for some. Be aware of other&#8217;s emotional needs, and express your genuine love and respect for them in terms that are real to YOU. Be yourself.
  7. Be Accountable for Don&#8217;t blame the problems in your life on other people. Look inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.
  8. Be Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.
  9. Resist the Urge to Control You can&#8217;t force others to adhere to your ways of thinking. You may think that you know what&#8217;s best for others, but you really only know how they can best act according to your ideas of what is right. Just as you are entitled to live as you see fit, so are they. Instead of judging and controlling others, focus on using your judgment to create better impartial principles.
 10. Spend Some Time Encourage the development of your introverted side. You&#8217;ll find many tangible benefits to becoming a better-rounded person.
