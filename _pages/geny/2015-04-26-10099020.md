Examples of models include the workflow model, the data-flow model, and the role model.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workflow model shows the sequence of activities in the process along with their inputs, outputs and dependencies. The activities in the model represent human actions.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dataflow model represents the process as a set of activities each of which carries out some data transformation. It shows how the input to the process such as specification is transformed to an output such as design. The activities here maybe lower than in a workflow model. They may represent transformations carries out by people or computers.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The role model represents the roles of people involved in the software process and the activities for which they are responsible.
