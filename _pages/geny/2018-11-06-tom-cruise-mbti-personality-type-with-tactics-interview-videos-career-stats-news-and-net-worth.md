**Thomas Cruise Mapother IV** (born July 3, 1962) is an American actor and producer. He started his career at age 19 in the film _Endless Love_ (1981), before making his breakthrough in the comedy _Risky Business_ (1983) and receiving widespread attention for starring in the action drama _Top Gun_ (1986) as Lieutenant Pete &#8220;Maverick&#8221; Mitchell. After starring in _The Color of Money_ (1986) and _Cocktail_(1988), Cruise starred opposite Dustin Hoffman in the Academy Award for Best Picture-winning drama _Rain Man_. For his role as anti-war activist Ron Kovic in the drama _Born on the Fourth of July_ (1989), Cruise received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama and his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination.

In the 1990s, Cruise starred with Jack Nicholson in the legal drama _A Few Good Men_ (1992) and starred in a number of box office hits including _The Firm_ (1993) and _Interview with the Vampire_ (1994), before starring as IMF agent Ethan Hunt in the action spy thriller _Mission: Impossible_ (1996), the first of a commercially successful six-film series. In 1996, Cruise also starred as the title character in the romantic comedy-drama _Jerry Maguire_, earning him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and his second Academy Award nomination. In 1999, Cruise starred in the erotic thriller _Eyes Wide Shut_ opposite his then wife Nicole Kidman and also appeared in the ensemble drama _Magnolia_, for which he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

After receiving a Saturn Award for Best Actor for his performance in the psychological thriller _Vanilla Sky_ (2001), Cruise collaborated with director Steven Spielberg on the science fiction thrillers _Minority Report_ (2002) and _War of the Worlds_ (2005). In 2008, he gave a supporting performance in the action comedy _Tropic Thunder_ and starred in the historical thriller _Valkyrie_ as Claus von Stauffenberg. In 2012, Cruise played the eponymous role in the thriller _Jack Reacher_. Cruise&#8217;s films have grossed more than $3.7 billion at U.S. and Canadian box offices and more than $9.0 billion worldwide,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">[1]</sup> making him the eighth highest-grossing actor in North America and one of the top-grossing actors worldwide.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference">[2]</sup>

Cruise has been married three times, to actresses Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman, Katie Holmes, and has three children, two of which were adopted during his marriage to Kidman and the other a biological daughter with Holmes. Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs, and credits it with helping him overcome dyslexia. In the 2000s, his Church-affiliated criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant drugs, particularly for 9/11 rescue workers, and his efforts to promote Scientology as a religion in Europe sparked controversies, as did a leaked video interview of him promoting Scientology.

## <span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span>

Cruise was born in Syracuse, New York, the son of Mary Lee (_née_ Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">[3]</sup> an electrical engineer, both originally from Louisville, Kentucky.<sup id="cite_ref-filmref_4-0" class="reference">[4]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">[5]</sup> He has three sisters: Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. They are of English, German, and Irish ancestry.<sup id="cite_ref-Tom_Cruise's_Irish_Ancestry_6-0" class="reference">[6]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">[7]</sup> One of Cruise&#8217;s paternal great-great-great-grandfathers, Patrick Russell Cruise, was born in north County Dublin in 1799; he married Teresa Johnson in County Meath, in 1825. They left Ireland for the United States that same year and settled in New York.<sup id="cite_ref-Tom_Cruise's_Irish_Ancestry_6-1" class="reference">[6]</sup> They had a daughter, Mary Paulina Russell Cruise, whose son Thomas Cruise Mapother was Cruise&#8217;s great-grandfather.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">[8]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-oid_9-0" class="reference">[9]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-genes_1_10-0" class="reference">[10]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-BBC_Wales_2_11-0" class="reference">[11]</sup> A cousin, William Mapother, is also an actor; he and Cruise have appeared in five films together.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">[12]</sup>

Cruise grew up in near poverty, and had a Catholic upbringing. The family was dominated by his abusive father, whom Cruise has described as &#8220;a merchant of chaos.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-parade_13-0" class="reference">[13]</sup> Cruise has said that he was beaten by his father, whom he has called a &#8220;bully and coward.&#8221; He stated, &#8220;He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he&#8217;d lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, &#8216;There&#8217;s something wrong with this guy. Don&#8217;t trust him. Be careful around him.'&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-parade_13-1" class="reference">[13]</sup>

Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. His family moved to Beacon Hill, Ottawa, in late 1971 so that Cruise&#8217;s father could take a position as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces.<sup id="cite_ref-Unauthorized_ex_14-0" class="reference">[14]</sup> There, Cruise attended the newly opened Robert Hopkins Public School for much of grade four and grade five.<sup id="cite_ref-Unauthorized_ex_14-1" class="reference">[14]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">[15]</sup> In grade four, Cruise first became involved in drama, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. Cruise and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called _IT_ at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival.<sup id="cite_ref-Unauthorized_ex_14-2" class="reference">[14]</sup> Drama organizer Val Wright, who was in the audience that night, reflected, &#8220;The movement and improvisation were excellent. It was a classic ensemble piece.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-Unauthorized_ex_14-3" class="reference">[14]</sup> Cruise also enjoyed sports at the school and played floor hockey, though he was known more for his aggression than his talent.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2016)">citation needed</span></i>]</sup>

In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. However, in the spring of that year, Cruise&#8217;s mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-Unauthorized_ex_14-4" class="reference">[14]</sup> His father died of cancer in 1984.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">[16]</sup> Cruise briefly attended a Franciscan seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, on a church scholarship and aspired to become a Catholic priest, before his interest in acting.<sup id="cite_ref-Unauthorized_17-0" class="reference">[17]</sup><sup class="reference">:24–26</sup> In his senior year, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but he was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.<sup id="cite_ref-Unauthorized_17-1" class="reference">[17]</sup><sup class="reference">:47</sup> In total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years, including stints in at least two suburban New Jersey towns, including Glen Ridge.<sup id="cite_ref-FamousNJ_18-0" class="reference">[18]</sup>

Cruise first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film _Endless Love_, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in _Taps_ later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of _The Outsiders_. That same year he appeared in _All the Right Moves_ and _Risky Business_, which has been described as &#8220;A Generation X classic, and a career-maker for Tom Cruise&#8221;,<sup id="cite_ref-rottentomatoes_19-0" class="reference">[19]</sup> and which, along with 1986&#8217;s _Top Gun_, cemented his status as a superstar.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference">[20]</sup> Cruise also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film _Legend_, released in 1985.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference">[21]</sup>

Cruise followed up _Top Gun_ with _The Color of Money_, which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. 1988 saw him star in _Cocktail_, which earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in _Rain Man_, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in 1989&#8217;s _Born on the Fourth of July_, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor &#8211; Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People&#8217;s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise&#8217;s first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.

Cruise&#8217;s next films were _Days of Thunder_ (1990) and _Far and Away_ (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan&#8217;s _Interview with the Vampire_, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice&#8217;s best-selling novel. The film was well received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in _Daily Variety_ praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">[22]</sup>

In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of _Mission: Impossible_, which he produced. It was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference">[23]</sup>

In 1996, he took on the title role in _Jerry Maguire_, for which he earned a Golden Globe and his second nomination for an Academy Award. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in the erotic Stanley Kubrick film _Eyes Wide Shut_, and took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in _Magnolia_, for which he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.

In 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the _Mission Impossible_ films, _Mission: Impossible 2_. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style, and continued the series&#8217; blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547M in worldwide figures. Like its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, and had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for this film.

His next five films were major critical and commercial successes.<sup id="cite_ref-boxofficemojotomcruise_24-0" class="reference">[24]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference">[25]</sup> The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller _Vanilla Sky_ (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction thriller _Minority Report_ which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick.

In 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick&#8217;s historical drama _The Last Samurai_, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in _War of the Worlds_, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4 million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People&#8217;s Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star, and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100 million at the box office.<sup id="cite_ref-boxofficemojotomcruise_24-1" class="reference">[24]</sup>

In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the _Mission Impossible_ film series, _Mission: Impossible III_. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400 million at the box office.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference">[26]</sup> In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in _Lions for Lambs_, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as &#8220;Les Grossman&#8221; in the 2008 comedy _Tropic Thunder_ with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller _Valkyrie_ released on December 25, 2008 to box office success.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference">[27]</sup>

In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy _Knight and Day_, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference">[28]</sup> On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in _Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol_, the fourth installment in the _Mission: Impossible_ series. The film was released in December 2011<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference">[29]</sup> to high critical acclaim<sup id="cite_ref-rt_30-0" class="reference">[30]</sup> and box office success.<sup id="cite_ref-ox_31-0" class="reference">[31]</sup>Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it is Cruise&#8217;s biggest commercial success to date.<sup id="cite_ref-Overseas5_32-0" class="reference">[32]</sup>

On May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre and Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference">[33]</sup> In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie _Rock of Ages_, in which he played the character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference">[34]</sup>

Cruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child&#8217;s 2005 novel _One Shot._ The film was released on December 21, 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference">[35]</sup> It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $216,568,266 worldwide.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference">[36]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference">[37]</sup> In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film _Oblivion_ based on director Joseph Kosinski&#8217;s graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed $285,600,588 worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference">[38]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference">[39]</sup>

As of mid-2015 Cruise&#8217;s films have grossed about $8.2 billion worldwide.<sup id="cite_ref-totalgross_40-0" class="reference">[40]</sup>

Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the _Mission: Impossible_ series, _Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation_, which he also produced.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference">[41]</sup> Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director.

Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff&#8217;s 1932 horror movie _The Mummy_.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference">[42]</sup> The new film, also titled _The Mummy_, was produced by Alex Kurtzman, Chris Morgan, and Sean Daniel, written by Jon Spaihts and directed by Kurtzman. In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, _Mission: Impossible – Fallout_.

### <span id="Producing" class="mw-headline">Producing</span>

Cruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993,<sup id="cite_ref-MGM_43-0" class="reference">[43]</sup> and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise&#8217;s films, the first being _Mission: Impossible_ in 1996 which was also Cruise&#8217;s first project as a producer.

Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as &#8220;one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood.&#8221; Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise&#8217;s tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise&#8217;s exceptional commercial prowess.<sup id="cite_ref-Epstein_44-0" class="reference">[44]</sup>

Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise&#8217;s film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on Erik Larson&#8217;s _New York Times_ bestseller, _The Devil in the White City_about a real life serial killer, H. H. Holmes, at Chicago&#8217;s World&#8217;s Columbian Exposition. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio&#8217;s production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the World&#8217;s Fair, in which DiCaprio will star.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference">[45]</sup>

Cruise has produced for multiple films in which he has been. He produced _Mission: Impossible_, _Without Limits_, _Mission: Impossible 2_, _The Others_, _Vanilla Sky_ and many others.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference">[46]</sup>

#### <span id="Break_with_Paramount" class="mw-headline">Break with Paramount</span>

On August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the _Wall Street Journal_, chairman of Viacom (Paramount&#8217;s parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise&#8217;s value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference">[47]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference">[48]</sup> Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount&#8217;s announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference">[49]</sup>

Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount&#8217;s discontent over Cruise/Wagner&#8217;s exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the _Mission: Impossible_ franchise.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference">[50]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference">[51]</sup>

#### <span id="Management_of_United_Artists" class="mw-headline">Management of United Artists</span>

In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists.<sup id="cite_ref-MGM_43-1" class="reference">[43]</sup> Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA&#8217;s chief executive.

Production began in 2007 of _Valkyrie_, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007 Cruise signed on to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, _Lions for Lambs_, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. _Lambs_ was released on November 9, 2007,<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference">[52]</sup> opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.

In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise&#8217;s share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference">[53]</sup>

## <span id="Relationships" class="mw-headline">Relationships</span>

Cruise has been divorced three times and has three children (two adopted and one biological).

In the early to mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with older women, including Rebecca De Mornay,<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference">[54]</sup> three years his senior; Patti Scialfa,<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference">[55]</sup> nine years his senior; and Cher,<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference">[56]</sup> 16 years his senior.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference">[57]</sup>

### <span id="Marriage_to_Mimi_Rogers" class="mw-headline">Marriage to Mimi Rogers</span>

Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference">[58]</sup> They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers introduced Cruise to the Church of Scientology.<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference">[59]</sup>

### <span id="Marriage_to_Nicole_Kidman" class="mw-headline">Marriage to Nicole Kidman</span>

Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film _Days of Thunder_ (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. Cruise and Kidman adopted two children, Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying in an interview, &#8220;It was wrongly reported,&#8221; and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference">[60]</sup> Before Kidman&#8217;s next marriage to Keith Urban, she spoke of how much she still loved Cruise, saying in 2006: &#8220;He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me. And I loved him. I still love him.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference">[61]</sup>

### <span id="Dating_Penelope_Cruz_and_Nazanin_Boniadi" class="mw-headline">Dating Penelope Cruz and Nazanin Boniadi</span>

Cruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in _Vanilla Sky_ (2001). Their relationship ended in 2004.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference">[62]</sup> An article in the October 2012 issue of _Vanity Fair_states that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, the Church of Scientology launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of &#8220;auditions&#8221; of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference">[63]</sup>

The Church of Scientology and Cruise&#8217;s lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing _Vanity Fair_ of &#8220;shoddy journalism&#8221; and &#8220;religious bigotry.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference">[64]</sup>Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference">[65]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference">[66]</sup>

Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, Mimi Rogers.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference">[80]</sup> Cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference">[81]</sup> and has said that Scientology, specifically the L. Ron Hubbard Study Tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference">[82]</sup>

### <span id="Cruise.27s_advocacy_of_Scientology"></span><span id="Cruise's_advocacy_of_Scientology" class="mw-headline">Cruise&#8217;s advocacy of Scientology</span>

In addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials Nicolas Sarkozy and Jean-Claude Gaudin, described him as a spokesman and militant for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference">[83]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference">[84]</sup>

Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from the medical profession<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference">[85]</sup> and from firefighters.<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference">[86]</sup>

For such activities, Scientology leader David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.<sup id="cite_ref-vanity_87-0" class="reference">[87]</sup>

### <span id="Criticism_of_psychiatry" class="mw-headline">Criticism of psychiatry</span>

In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement &#8220;I think psychiatry should be outlawed.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-Desai_88-0" class="reference">[88]</sup> Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an anti-depressant to which Shields attributes her recovery from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. Shields responded that Cruise &#8220;should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference">[89]</sup> This led to a heated argument between Matt Lauer and Cruise on NBC&#8217;s _Today_ on June 24, 2005.<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference">[90]</sup>

Medical authorities view Cruise&#8217;s comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness.<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference">[91]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference">[92]</sup> Shields herself called Cruise&#8217;s comments &#8220;a disservice to mothers everywhere.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference">[93]</sup>In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference">[94]</sup>

Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the psychoactive drugs which are routinely prescribed for treatment.<sup id="cite_ref-vanity_87-1" class="reference">[87]</sup> It was reported that Cruise&#8217;s anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference">[95]</sup> Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise&#8217;s presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor&#8217;s office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference">[96]</sup>

On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him.<sup id="cite_ref-warne_97-0" class="reference">[97]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-knbc_98-0" class="reference">[98]</sup> The Church of Scientology said the video had been &#8220;pirated and edited,&#8221; and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology.<sup id="cite_ref-knbc_98-1" class="reference">[98]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-Church_of_Scientology_Slams_German_Tabloid_99-0" class="reference">[99]</sup> YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.<sup id="cite_ref-vamosi_anonymous_hackers_100-0" class="reference">[100]</sup>

After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause.

In 2013, Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple&#8217;s daughter Suri from Scientology. He also said that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference">[102]</sup>

In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise&#8217;s next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise&#8217;s sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005.<sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference">[103]</sup> DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference">[104]</sup> Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.<sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference">[105]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference">[106]</sup>

The 2015 documentary _Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief_ cast a spotlight on Cruise&#8217;s role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used Sea Org workers as a source of free labor.<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference">[107]</sup> In the film, Cruise&#8217;s former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Tom Cruise&#8217;s suggestion (which Cruise&#8217;s lawyer denies).<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference">[108]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference">[109]</sup>

### <span id=".22Tom_Cruise_Picture.22"></span><span id="&quot;Tom_Cruise_Picture&quot;" class="mw-headline">&#8220;Tom Cruise Picture&#8221;</span>

While reviewing _Days of Thunder_, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise&#8217;s 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the _Tom Cruise Picture_. Some of Cruise&#8217;s later films like _A Few Good Men_ and _The Last Samurai_ can also be considered to be part of this formula.

_Widescreenings_ noted that for Tom Cruise&#8217;s character Daniel Kaffee in _A Few Good Men_, &#8220;[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of _Top Gun_, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In _Top Gun_, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a &#8216;hot shot&#8217; military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.&#8221; Sorkin and director Rob Reiner are praised in gradually unveiling Kaffee&#8217;s potential in the film.<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference">[118]</sup>

## <span id="Litigation" class="mw-headline">Litigation</span>

During Cruise&#8217;s marriage to Nicole Kidman, the couple endured a great deal of public speculation about their sex life and rumors that Cruise was gay. In 1998, he successfully sued the _Daily Express_, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality.<sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference">[119]</sup>

In May 2001, he filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had allegedly told the celebrity magazine _Actustar_ that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference">[120]</sup> and in August 2001, Slater was ordered to pay $10 million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default.<sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference">[121]</sup>

Cruise also sued _Bold Magazine_ publisher Michael Davis, who alleged but never confirmed that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.<sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference">[122]</sup>
