              Tactics
            </h3>
            
            <p>
              Formation: 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                &#8220;We speak about Burnley and Bournemouth, because they are recent. But you&#8217;ve only got to look at Crystal Palace, Watford, Leicester a few years ago, and going back further Stoke and West Brom.
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              &#8220;They have toughed out difficult times to become mainstays in the division and that&#8217;s the challenge.&#8221;
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                &#8220;There is no doubt that for any team going from the Championship to the Premier League, you have got to win the games around you, against teams that are recently promoted.
              </li>
              <li>
                &#8220;You know wins against (Manchester) United and Arsenal and Chelsea are very difficult to come by.
              </li>
              <li>
                &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t deal with them but the law of averages say the way you are going to stay in the Premier League is by winning the games against the teams that are around you.&#8221;
              </li>
              <li>
                &#8220;I&#8217;ll get a break,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is important and I never mind admitting I need a break. It&#8217;s a long, hard season in the Championship, a lot of games that are full on.
              </li>
              <li>
                &#8220;I look forward to a nice break and coming back refreshed.
              </li>
              <li>
                &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited for everybody at the club about next season.&#8221;
              </li>

            <pre><strong>MBTI Personality: INTJ</strong> Any thoughts about other ones? I've got my thoughts, but I'm not really sure of them, so I think I'll wait for other theories about further managers (and players). You may leave a comment Below, Suggesting your best matching MBTI Personality. 
Thank you.</pre></div> </div>
