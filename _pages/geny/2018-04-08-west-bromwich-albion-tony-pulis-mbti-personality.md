<pre class="subHeader">Manager Bio

<strong>Tony Pulis has managed three clubs in the Premier League, most recently with West Bromwich Albion.</strong>

Pulis had taken over at newly-promoted Premier League side Crystal Palace in November 2013, only a few months after bringing an end to a successful tenure in charge of Stoke City.

The Welshman led the Potters to the Premier League for the first time in 2007/08 with automatic promotion from the Championship and then kept the club safely in the top flight for the next five years, which included a run to the 2010/11 FA Cup Final.

Despite losing to Manchester City at Wembley Stadium, the cup run ensured that Stoke qualified for the UEFA Europa League for the following season.&nbsp;The Potters progressed through the group stages before being edged 2-0 on aggregate by Spanish side Valencia in the first knock-out round.

Pulis spent over a decade at the Staffordshire club&nbsp;collectively and after being appointed as Crystal Palace manager, he guided the Eagles from the relegation zone to an 11th-place finish.&nbsp;

A remarkable run of form in the closing stages of the season included five consecutive wins, which helped him win the Manager of the Month award for April 2014 before earning the Manager of the Year accolade in his debut campaign with the south London club.

Pulis departed the Eagles prior to the 2014/15 campaign, but it was not long before he was back in the Premier League.

West Brom came calling midway through the 2014/15 campaign and Pulis successfully guided the Baggies to Premier League safety for another season before finishing 14th in 2015/16.

A strong first half of the 2016/17 campaign led Tony Pulis' side to a 10th place finish, but two wins from their opening 12 matches resulted in the Welshman departing the club on 20 November 2017.

<strong>MBTI Personality: ISFJ</strong>

Any thoughts about other ones? I've got my thoughts, but I'm not really sure of them, so I think I'll wait for other theories about further managers (and players).
