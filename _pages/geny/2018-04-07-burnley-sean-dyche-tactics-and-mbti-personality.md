### Manager Bio {.subHeader}

**The 2016/17 season is Sean Dyche&#8217;s second Premier League campaign&nbsp;with Burnley following their 2014/15 relegation.**

Kettering-born Dyche started his playing career in the youth ranks at Nottingham Forest before joining Chesterfield in 1990.

The defender made over 250 appearances, captained the club and scored in their famous FA Cup semi-final against Middlesbrough in 1997.

Bristol City signed Dyche in 2007 and he helped the club get promotion to the Championship in his first season.

Following a brief loan spell with Luton Town, Dyche joined Millwall in 2009 and also achieved promotion to the Championship with the London club.

The defender signed for Watford in 2002 and captained them during the 2004/05 season.

That was to be his last season as a player with club and he signed for Northampton Town before retiring in 2007.

Dyche’s coaching career started with Watford’s youth team shortly after retiring and he soon made his way up to assistant manager under Malky Mackay.

The Scot left Watford ahead of the 2011/12 campaign and Dyche was promoted to become the Hornets’ manager in June 2011, with his first match&nbsp;in charge coming against Burnley at Turf Moor.

Watford and Dyche parted company in 2012 and the Englishman then spent a spell working with the England under-21 side as part of the staff put together by Stuart Pearce, who was a former playing colleague at Forest.

Burnley announced Dyche as their manager in October 2012 and he guided the club to second in the 2013/14 Championship season to automatically promote the Clarets to the Premier League.

Dyche was unable to keep the Clarets in the top-flight, but he guided the club to an immediate&nbsp;Premier League return after lifting the&nbsp;Championship trophy in the 2015/16 campaign.</section> 

#### Tactical Philosophy

Dyche’s methods are traditional in the sense that he opts for tried and tested methods, applying his own spin on them to good effect in a variety of different situations. Setting his teams up to be tough to defeat, Dyche has a side with disciplined players who understand the importance of defending, as well as a few with attacking flair, helping to balance their approach in different match situations.

At Burnley especially, one of their strengths has been from set-pieces. Having tall, imposing figures across the pitch makes them even more of a challenge to break down against better teams, who usually have more technical players in comparison.

**Formation and Tactical Structure**

His preference to play a traditional 4-4-2 formation has paid off on many an occasion against tougher opposition, especially given how frustrating it can be to attack against two banks of four. It’s increasingly tough against more experienced players who understand and are able to assess weaknesses before they become an attacking threat in match situations.

He sometimes uses the 4-5-1 or 4-1-4-1 formations, utilising a lone striker to press the backline whilst midfield players balance supplying him with chances whilst maintaining their defensive responsibilities.

Dyche has adapted his tactical structure to cope with the jump from Championship to Premier League football in more effective fashion than the initial time they returned to the top flight. 33 points from 38 matches saw them finish in 19th and already this term, they’ve surpassed the previous total with 36 at the time of writing.

Snatching results against teams they would have usually been defeated by has helped, but tactics has also made them a harder team to score against. Middlesbrough (37) are the only side who have conceded less than Burnley’s 44 in the bottom half and it’s no coincidence either.

At both Watford and Burnley, Dyche has managed to get the best out of his forwards. Usually having one athletic striker – Troy Deeney and Andre Gray – alongside a more creative player like Marvin Sordell or Sam Vokes. In the two screenshots below, you’ll see how Burnley have benefited from a high-pressing tactic that has started in attack and progressively worked its way back towards their own goal.
