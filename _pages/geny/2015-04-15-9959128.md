<span style="font-family:Verdana;"><strong>1.</strong> Set up a Divide-by-2 counter using one D-flop from a 74HCT74N chip. Drive the counter with a square wave from a 555 Timer that you&#8217;ve set up to have a period of about half a second. Drive a red LED with the 555 Timer&#8217;s square wave, and a green LED with the Q output from the D-flop.</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">At what rate should the green LED blink? How can we interpret the green and red LED&#8217;s as numbers?</span></p> 

<span style="font-family:Verdana;"><strong>2.</strong> Add two more stages to the Divide-by-2 counter from above, making a 3-bit ripple counter. Drive an output LED with each Q outout, and watch it count happily.</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Now, use a scope to watch two of the Q outputs. Expand the time axis to see the propagation delay. How much delay is there per stage?</span></p> 

<span style="font-family:Verdana;"><strong>3.</strong> Set up a synchronous counter using an SN74HC193N chip, or similar. Drive the UP and DOWN counters with straight (not-debounced) logic-level pushbutton inputs. Drive LED&#8217;s from the Q-outputs.</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Click along with your pushbutton UP. What problems do you find using a not-debounced switch to clock the counter?</span></p> 

<span style="font-family:Verdana;"><strong>4.</strong>Add a debouncer to the UP clock. Design and build a Divide-by-5 counter, using only the SN74HC193N, and the debounced UP input. The Divide-by-5 counter should light an LED every 5th time the user has pressed the UP pushbutton.</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;"><em>Hint: you&#8217;ll need to use the LOAD&#8217; function of the chip, in conjunction with CO&#8217;.</em></span>
