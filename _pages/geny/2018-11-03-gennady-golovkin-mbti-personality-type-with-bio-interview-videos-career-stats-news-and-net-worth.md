        <p id="1L0H5T">
          Ah, but will it be the right kind of drama, the preferred kind, not the too oft seen sort we are handed in boxing?
        </p>
        
        <p id="4OaUIw">
          Will we the fans be dissecting the ebbs and flows in action after midnight on September 15, or will we be adding new names to the pantheon of shame, locking a person or two into Twitter jail for the crime of being inept at judging prizefights?
        </p>
        
        <p id="IQjfdc">
          Fingers and toes are crossed that will not be the case, and the best way to ensure that we get no CJ Ross and Duane Ford repeats is for Gennady Golovkin or Canelo Alvarez to remove the arbiters from the equation.
        </p>

          Render them null, void, un-needed.
