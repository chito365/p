<pre class="subHeader"><strong>Slaven Bilic managed West Ham United in the Premier League between 2015 and 2017.</strong>

The Croatian, who played for West Ham and Everton in the Premier League, began his managerial career at Hajduk Split in 2001, the same club he started plying his trade as a player.

Bilic racked up over 100 appearances for the club across two spells and also represented his country 44 times as he helped Croatia finish third at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

Following his short spell as manager&nbsp;at Hajduk Split, Bilic then went on to coach the Croatia under-21 side in 2004 before being announced as the national team manager in the summer of 2006.

During Bilic's six years in charge of Croatia, he guided the country to the quarter-finals of the 2008 UEFA European Championship, while also helping knock England out of the qualifying campaign leading up to the tournament.

A year-long stay with Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow followed his tenure as Croatia manager before spending two years in Turkey with Besiktas.

On 12 June 2015, West Ham appointed Bilic as Sam Allardyce's successor.

Back in the Premier League for the first time since his Goodison Park playing days in 1999,&nbsp;West Ham went on to finish seventh under Bilic's guidance, which led to the London side entering the third qualifying round of the&nbsp;UEFA Europa League for the 2016/17 season.

The Hammers were knocked out in the Play-off round of the UEFA Europa League in the following campaign and ended the Premier League season in 11th place.

With the east London side in the bottom three after 11 league matches, Bilic left West Ham in early November 2017.</pre>

###### **MBTI Personality: INTJ** Any thoughts about other ones? I&#8217;ve got my thoughts, but I&#8217;m not really sure of them, so I think I&#8217;ll wait for other theories about further managers (and players).
