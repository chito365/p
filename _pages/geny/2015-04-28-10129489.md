<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Definition: Science of collection, presentation, analysis, and reasonable interpretation of data.<br />Statistics presents a rigorous scientific method for gaining insight into data. For example, suppose we measure the weight of 100 patients in a study. With so many measurements, simply looking at the data fails to provide an informative account. However statistics can give an instant overall picture of data based on graphical presentation or numerical summarization irrespective to the number of data points. Besides data summarization, another important task of statistics is to make inference and predict relations of variables.</p>
