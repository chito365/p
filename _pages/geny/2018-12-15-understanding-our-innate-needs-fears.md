### UNDERSTANDING OUR INNATE NEEDS & FEARS

Have you ever wondered why some people aren’t afraid of the same things that you are? Perhaps you have a friend who jumps out of planes for fun and you wouldn’t do it if you were paid. Or you find it easy to ask direct questions when you are looking for information, while others are afraid of embarrassing themselves. We call people brave when they do something we are afraid to and yet for these people, it isn’t frightening. We think they are courageous, when they are acting out of their comfort zone. This is because our brains are wired with a predominant need and an innate fear of not getting that need met. Once this fear is triggered, the self‐protective behaviors of the Style emerge in an attempt to get the need met. The fear is triggered whether we are aware of it or not.

&nbsp;

**Knowing how our brain is organized to function helps** **us** **understand** **and address our psychological  needs** **and** **fears.** Nothing helps  determine  predictable patterns of behavior faster than assessing our personality type. Add to this an understanding the predominant needs and innate fears of each personality type and we have a window into the drivers of behavior each one. While we can understand normal behaviour of each personality type using the Myers‐Briggs Type Indicator®, the Striving Styles Personality System adds the emotional dimension that allows us to see the predominant needs and innate fears that drive the behavior of each of the 16 MBTI Types. It provides a way to understand the full human experience: how personality, needs, emotions, conditioning and brain development impact on behavior.

&nbsp;

### BUILDING AWARENESS WITH THE STRIVING STYLES PERSONALITY SYSTEM

** **

Before we can develop or change our behavior, we must first understand ourselves. **The Striving Styles** **Personality** **System** **is the only developmental** **framework** **that integrates multiple disciplines and** **theories** **‐ including the latest advances in** **neuroscience – in order to reflect the full human** **experience**, giving people the tools to shift their behavior and fully achieve their potential.

&nbsp;

The Striving Styles is an evolution of Carl Jung’s Theory of Personality Type, popularized by the MBTI®, True Colors® and DiSC®. However, its focus on the brain shows people how to break longstanding patterns of behavior that get in the way of their success.

&nbsp;

##### EMOTIONS, NOT THOUGHTS, DRIVE BEHAVIOR

The Striving Styles is based on the assertion that each of us is born with a predominant need and pattern of

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

energy (Striving Style) that determines how we behave in order to get the need met. Rather than just informing people on ‘how’ they prefer to behave, it lets people understand the true drivers of their behavior – needs and emotions.

&nbsp;

The SSPS is a complete system which includes both assessment and a clear path for development based on a person’s brain organization. It shows how the brain is organized, how needs and emotions influence behavior as well as how to develop by having experiences that literally remap your brain and satisfy your predominant need.

&nbsp;

##### LEVERAGE YOUR WHOLE BRAIN

The SSPS provides a way to easily understand and leverage brain functioning to consciously influence how a person behaves. Through the Striving Styles, individuals understand their  Predominant Style (“Alpha”) as well as the three Associate Styles they have access to, each of the needs that drive behavior, the role these Styles play in their personality as well as how to maximize the potential of their talents.

&nbsp;

**Rather** **than** **looking** **at people as one dimensional, or** **in terms of strengths vs. weaknesses, the SSPS shows** **people how to leverage and integrate the striving** **energies** **of** **all** **four quadrants of their brain.** As well, we show people how their instinctual and emotional brains – called their Self‐Protective System – shift their behavior and get in the way of their development, and how they can self‐actualize by strengthening connections with their rational brain.

&nbsp;

The truth is that most of us just don’t understand our own needs, fears, and habits of mind very well, so we sabotage ourselves by living life at less than full throttle. We let our fear define and decide what experiences we

&nbsp;

will have and what we will say, because we are afraid of stirring up emotions in others or ourselves. Over time, we may accept this compromise as living, when, unknown to us, all we are really doing is living life on autopilot and trying not to rock the boat. Our innate fears are varied. They are based on our strongest motivations (striving energies) and their associated psychological needs. We are conditioned to judge our fears rather than to examine them and ask ourselves the purpose of the feeling. **Only through** **understanding the motivation and need attached to** **the fear, can we stop acting out of the fear.**

** **

Based on the Striving Styles® Personality System, there are eight distinct psychological needs, which are rooted in the four quadrants of the brain (two per quadrant). One of these needs is your ‘alpha’ or predominant need, so it has the greatest influence over your behavior and sense of security. It also determines the innate fear that wields the greatest power in your life when you are not aware of it or when it is being triggered.
