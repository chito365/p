### **Kodak Black Facts**

  1. In June 2017, Kodak was caught up in a controversy when he said that he didn’t like black girls while interacting with fans during an Instagram Live Stream. After trying to clarify his comments, he deactivated his Instagram account and took shots at his critics on Twitter.
  2. In April, Jennifer Cunningham, who worked as a bartender at Dade strip club, accused Kodak of assaulting her and stomping over her at the Miami based club in February.
  3. In his _Project Baby_ documentary, Kodak revealed that he was bright in studies while growing up. He was even accepted in a private school outside of his improvised and crime-ridden community. However, he decided against joining it.
  4. When he was 16 years old, he was kicked out of his home.
  5. When he was growing up, his mother became a victim of a robbery as the assailants took off with his family’s tax return money. The incident hardened him and pushed him towards crime. It also inspired a verse in his single, _Signs._
  6. He started his rap journey at the age of 12 after he became a member of a rap group called Brutal Youngnz and adopted the stage name _J-Black_.
  7. His first arrest was for burglary and at the time of his arrest, he wasn’t even 16 years old. He had to spend 21 days in jail. However, he was prepared for it because he was robbing long enough to know what was in store for him.
  8. So bad was his involvement in crime in his teenage years that he had to be placed in a youth detention center three times in a single year.
  9. In August 2016, Kodak appeared in court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida after having been arrested on numerous occasions on a wide range of charges that included false imprisonment of a child, possession of cannabis, and fleeing from police officers. After having entered a plea deal, he pleaded no contest to all the charges and was handed a one-year house arrest, five years’ probation, and was asked to attend anger management classes.
 10. However, before he was released from jail, it was found that there have been two outstanding warrants against him for criminal sexual conduct and for cannabis possession. He was slapped with four months jail sentence for drug charges.
 11. The woman accusing him of sexual assault revealed that she had attended his performance at Treasure City in Florence after which she joined him in his hotel room, where he tore her clothes off before biting her and raping her.
 12. In February 2017, his musical tour had to be postponed after he was arrested for violating his probation. A couple of months later, he was sentenced for violating his house arrest as well.
 13. In January 2017, he landed in a major controversy as he broadcasted a video on Instagram of him with a couple of men in a hotel room with a lone woman performing oral s*x on them.
 14. He is pretty fond of tattoos and has got cross tattooed on both his cheeks as well as forehead. He has also got a knife tattooed on the right side of his neck.
