Most people don’t have a personal mission statement which is why I am including some here  
based on each Enneagram type’s innate gifts, talents, interests and values. A personal mission  
statement is nothing more than a brief written statement of your overall purpose in life, your  
personal vision for who you want to be in and for the world. Helen Keller once said, “The most  
pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but has no vision.” I would use the word  
pitiable (as in evoking compassion) instead of pathetic but otherwise I agree with her. Without a  
“why” to live for that makes a unique contribution life quickly becomes empty and meaningless.

you may notice a repeating  
theme.  
1. My mission is to help people understand the shadow (dark) side of the human personality  
2. My mission is to help people get in touch with their heart’s wisdom and live from their  
authentic self  
3. My mission is to touch, move, and inspire people with my paintings and poetry  
4. My mission is to help people restore their life force energy by practicing Tai Chi and Qigong  
5. My mission is to help people discover their life purpose  
6. My mission is to teach Buddhist meditations that heal and awaken the heart  
7. My mission is to teach people how to make floral arrangements as a spiritual practice  
8. My mission is to lead silent spiritual retreats where people can reconnect with their soul  
9. My mission is to awaken our core intelligence through the mind-body practice of yoga  
10. My mission is to teach meditation techniques that return one’s mind back to its natural,  
enlightened, peaceful state  
11. My mission is to sing heartfelt music that touches the deepest recesses of a person’s soul
