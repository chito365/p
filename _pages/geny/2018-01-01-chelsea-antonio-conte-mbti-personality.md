      Manager Bio

    <p>
      <strong>Antonio Conte signed a three-year deal to take charge of Chelsea in April 2016 as a permanent replacement for interim manager Guus Hiddink.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Hiddink was in charge of the Blues from mid-December onwards of the 2015/16 campaign after the departure&nbsp;of Jose Mourinho, with Conte officially taking over at Stamford Bridge after guiding Italy to the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2016.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The 46-year-old coach enjoyed an illustrious playing career, the majority of which was spent at Juventus. He rose to prominence at his hometown club US Lecce but was signed by Giovanni Traptattoni and moved to Turin in 1991.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Five Serie A titles followed with other successes coming via the Coppa Italia, Supercoppa Italiana, UEFA Cup, UEFA Super Cup and UEFA Intertoto Cup. He also won the UEFA Champions League in 1995/96 and finished as a runner-up on three other occasions.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Conte, who also represented Italy at the 1994 FIFA World Cup and the 2000 UEFA European Championship, hung up his boots in 2004 and turned to coaching shortly after.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After starting as assistant manager at Arezzo in 2005/06, he was handed his first manager role by the same club in July of 2006 before moving to Bari in December 2007.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In his first full season in charge, Bari were crowned Serie B champions and promoted to Serie A for the 2009/10 season.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Brief spells at Atalanta and Siena followed and after he led the latter back to Italy’s top-flight, he agreed to move to Juventus in May 2011.&nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Three consecutive Serie A titles were won under the stewardship of Conte, as well as back-to-back Supercoppa Italiana successes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      During his stay in Turin, Conte won the Panchina d&#8217;Oro – awarded to the best Serie A coach of the season &#8211; for each of his three years in charge.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After resigning in the summer of 2014, Conte replaced Cesare Prandelli as head coach of the Italy national side, leading the Azzurri to UEFA Euro 2016 qualification with seven wins and three draws in qualifying.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Following Italy&#8217;s UEFA Euro 2016 quarter-final defeat to Germany, Conte joined up with Chelsea for their pre-season to lead the Blues into the 2016/17 Premier League campaign.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      His first campaign was a successful one, winning the Premier League title at the first attempt.

      ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT OTHER ONES? I’VE GOT MY THOUGHTS, BUT I’M NOT REALLY SURE OF THEM, SO I THINK I’LL WAIT FOR OTHER THEORIES ABOUT FURTHER MANAGERS (AND PLAYERS).
