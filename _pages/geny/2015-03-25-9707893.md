<font face="Verdana">Issue-Specific Security Policy (ISSP)<br />Provides detailed, targeted guidance to instruct organization in secure use of technology systems<br />Begins with introduction to fundamental technological philosophy of organization<br />Serves to protect employee and organization from inefficiency/ambiguity<br />Documents how technology-based system is controlled<br />Identifies processes and authorities that provide this control<br />Serves to indemnify organization against liability for inappropriate or illegal system use</font>

<font face="Verdana">Every organization’s ISSP should:<br />Address specific technology-based systems<br />Require frequent updates<br />Contain an issue statement on the organization’s position on an issue</font>

<font face="Verdana">Components of the ISSP<br />Statement of Purpose<br />Scope and Applicability<br />Definition of Technology Addressed<br />Responsibilities<br />Authorized Access and Usage of Equipment<br />User Access<br />Fair and Responsible Use<br />Protection of Privacy<br />Prohibited Usage of Equipment<br />Disruptive Use or Misuse<br />Criminal Use<br />Offensive or Harassing Materials<br />Copyrighted, Licensed or other Intellectual Property<br />Other Restrictions<br />Systems Management<br />Management of Stored Materials<br />Employer Monitoring<br />Virus Protection<br />Physical Security<br />Encryption<br />Violations of Policy<br />Procedures for Reporting Violations<br />Penalties for Violations<br />Policy Review and Modification<br />Scheduled Review of Policy and Procedures for Modification<br />Limitations of Liability<br />Statements of Liability or Disclaimers</font>

<font face="Verdana">Implementing ISSP<br />Common approaches:<br />Number of independent ISSP documents<br />Single comprehensive ISSP document<br />Modular ISSP document that unifies policy creation and administration&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Recommended approach is modular policy, which provides a balance between issue orientation and policy management</font>

<font face="Verdana">Systems-Specific Policy (SysSP)<br />Systems-Specific Policies (SysSPs) frequently do not look like other types of policy<br />They may often be created to function as standards or procedures to be used when configuring or maintaining systems<br />SysSPs can be separated into:<br />Management guidance<br />Technical specifications<br />Combined in a single policy document</font>

<font face="Verdana">Management Guidance SysSPs<br />Created by management to guide the implementation and configuration of technology<br />Applies to any technology that affects the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information<br />Informs technologists of management intent<br />Technical Specifications SysSPs<br />System administrators directions on implementing managerial policy<br />Each type of equipment has its own type of policies</font>

<font face="Verdana">Two general methods of implementing such technical controls:<br />Access control lists<br />Configuration rules</font>

<font face="Verdana">Access Control Lists<br />Include user access lists, matrices, and capability tables that govern rights and privileges<br />Can control access to file storage systems, object brokers or other network communications devices<br />Capability Table: similar method that specifies which subjects and objects users or groups can access&nbsp;<br />Specifications are frequently complex matrices, rather than simple lists or tables<br />Level of detail and specificity (often called granularity) may vary from system to system<br />ACLs enable administrations to restrict access according to user, computer, time, duration, or even a particular file</font>

<font face="Verdana">ACLs<br />In general ACLs regulate:<br />Who can use the system<br />What authorized users can access<br />When authorized users can access the system<br />Where authorized users can access the system from<br />How authorized users can access the system<br />Restricting what users can access, e.g. printers, files, communications, and applications<br />Administrators set user privileges, such as:<br />Read<br />Write<br />Create<br />Modify<br />Delete<br />Compare<br />Copy</font>

<font face="Verdana">Configuration Rules<br />Configuration rules are specific configuration codes entered into security systems to guide execution of system when information is passing through it<br />Rule policies are more specific to system operation than ACLs and may or may not deal with users directly<br />Many security systems require specific configuration scripts telling systems what actions to perform on each set of information processed</font>

<font face="Verdana">Combination SysSPs<br />Often organizations create a single document combining elements of both Management Guidance and Technical Specifications SysSPs<br />While this can be confusing, it is very practical<br />Care should be taken to articulate required actions carefully as procedures are presented</font>

<font face="Verdana">Guidelines for Policy Development<br />It is often useful to view policy development as a two-part project<br />Design and develop policy (or redesign and rewrite outdated policy)<br />Establish management processes to perpetuate policy within organization</font>

<font face="Verdana">The Policy Project<br />Policy development or re-development projects should be well planned, properly funded, and aggressively managed to ensure completion on time and within budget<br />When a policy development project is undertaken, the project can be guided by the SecSDLC process<br />Investigation Phase<br />The policy development team should:<br />Obtain support from senior management, and active involvement of IT management, specifically CIO<br />Clearly articulate goals of policy project<br />Gain participation of correct individuals affected by recommended policies<br />Be composed from Legal, Human Resources and end-users<br />Assign project champion with sufficient stature and prestige<br />Acquire a capable project manager<br />Develop detailed outline of and sound estimates for the cost and scheduling of the project<br />Analysis Phase<br />Analysis phase should include the following activities:<br />New or recent risk assessment or IT audit documenting the current information security needs of the organization<br />Key reference materials—including any existing policies</font>

<font face="Verdana">Design Phase<br />Design phase should include:<br />How policies will be distributed<br />How verification of distribution will be accomplished<br />Specifications for any automated tools<br />Revisions to feasibility analysis reports based on improved costs and benefits as design is clarified</font>

<font face="Verdana">Implementation Phase<br />Implementation Phase: writing the policies<br />Make certain policies are enforceable as written<br />Policy distribution is not always as straightforward<br />Effective policy<br />Is written at a reasonable reading level<br />Attempts to minimize technical jargon and management terminology</font>

<font face="Verdana">Maintenance Phase<br />Maintain and modify policy as needed to ensure that it remains effective as a tool to meet changing threats<br />Policy should have a built-in mechanism via which users can report problems with the policy, preferably anonymously<br />Periodic review should be built in to the process</font>

<font face="Verdana">The Information Security Policy Made Easy Approach&nbsp; (ISPME)<br />Gathering Key Reference Materials<br />Defining A Framework For Policies<br />Preparing A Coverage Matrix<br />Making Critical Systems Design Decisions<br />Structuring Review, Approval, And Enforcement Processes<br />Coverage Matrix</font>

<font face="Verdana">Guide for Developing Security Plans<br />Policies:<br />Living documents that constantly change and grow<br />Must be properly disseminated (distributed, read, understood and agreed to) and managed<br />Good management practices for policy development and maintenance make for a more resilient organization<br />In order to remain current and viable, policies must have:<br />Individual responsible for reviews<br />Schedule of reviews<br />Method for making recommendations for reviews<br />Indication of policy and revision date</font>

<font face="Verdana">Policies exist first, and foremost, to inform employees of what is and is not acceptable behavior in the organization<br />Policy seeks to improve employee productivity, and prevent potentially embarrassing situations</font>
