Coutesy of [RoysFarm](http://www.roysfarm.com/goat-farming/). Being [a passionate urban farmer](http://afriqueunique.mywapblog.com/about.xhtml), i like doing some researches.

Farming to me is not an old-school thing.

It is an opportunity infact a great venture to meet the costraints of the [current world](http://www.oscarkemboi.xyz/category/black-community/1.xhtml) situation.

I consider smart farming to change [status and livelihoods](http://www.oscarkemboi.xyz/category/fine-living/1.xhtml) of our precious people.

Below are some of the best reccommended goat breeds:

Boer, Savinnah, Kalahari Red, Alpine, Gono Altai and Toggenburg are very suitable for meat

Saanen, Jamunapari, Toggenburg, Anglo Nubian, Alpine

Boer, Beetal, Matou, Black Bengal

Much love and Happy Times!
