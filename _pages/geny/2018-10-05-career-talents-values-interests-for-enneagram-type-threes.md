**So, what DO Arnold Schwarzenegger and Oprah Winfrey have in**  
**common, both being Enneagram type Threes?**

All Threes organize their lives around achieving goals so that they can gain recognition and  
admiration from others. Whatever occupation Threes do they want to be recognized as one of the  
best at what they do (if not the best!), even if they are a homemaker, a monk or a nun! Threes  
truly believe they will be successful at whatever they attempt so consequently they usually are.  
Threes seem to be born with many of the qualities that naturally lead to success – selfconfidence,  
drive, ambition, determination, a goal focus, efficient industriousness, persistence,  
charm, charisma, personality, tact and the ability to network and market themselves in an  
appealing way. Doesn’t that sound like both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Oprah Winfrey?

Threes can have either a Two wing or a Four wing. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a Three  
with a Two wing and Oprah Winfrey is a Three with a Four wing. If, after clicking on the  
previous links, you feel that you are more of a Three with a strong Two wing, look at what  
Enneagram type Twos need for career satisfaction as well. If you feel you are more of a Three  
with a strong Four wing, look at what Enneagram type Fours need for career satisfaction as well.  
Average to unhealthy Threes can be workaholics because they are so motivated  
by the need for personal recognition and admiration. Imagine that your self-worth, your whole  
sense of identity even, was wrapped up in being successful in your career (and every other aspect  
of life too, actually)! What might that cause some Threes to do? Some might be so driven to  
succeed at all costs that they become overly competitive, opportunistic, unprincipled and  
deceptive. They might lie to impress people about how successful they are when they really  
aren’t. They cut corners at work to save time and money. They might create a product or  
market themselves with the necessary skills or expertise to do the job.

Healthy Threes are motivated by the need to live up to their own potential. They follow their  
heart and do what they love so often serve as paragons and exemplars of authenticity and innerdirectedness.  
Healthy Threes set an example for others of optimum human potential. Examples  
of healthy Threes are Jack Canfield, Joe Montana, Deepak Chopra, Anthony Robbins, Brian  
Tracy, Dale Carnegie, Zig Ziglar, Michael Jordan, Ben Kinsley, Barbra Streisand, Denzel  
Washington, Bill Clinton, Christopher Reeve, Rachel Ray and Jimmy Carter.
