_Don’t_ _ask_ _what_ _the_ _world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive._

#### —Howard Thurman

Corporate culture as a whole is perhaps the exact antithesis of the INFP personality. Though this type is aware that they need money to survive,

they are largely unmotivated by cash or similar traditional measures of success. Instead, INFPs seek out careers that align with their values and allow them opportunities to create change in the world around them.

Though this bright and creative type possesses the ability to excel at just about any career they put their minds to, they often struggle to find a workplace that allows them to bring their authentic self to the job every day. For this reason, the young INFP may change career paths various times over the course of their life, until they find a trajectory that aligns with their interests and values.

It’s important for any INFP career seeker to keep in mind that their indirect process of carving out a career they love is wholly normal for their type. INFPs may be quick to get down on themselves about their inability to immediately find a satisfying and meaningful career for themselves but in reality, they simply need to give their extroverted intuition enough time to try out various options and narrow down what they like best.

At the end of the day, there is no one perfect career for any type—just certain careers that correspond more closely to what each type is looking for. According to research conducted by Team Technology (2016) INFPs most commonly report being employed in the following fields:

&nbsp;

Writing Counseling

&nbsp;

Design The Arts

The Ministry Academia

Technical Specialist Psychology

&nbsp;

While it may be helpful to look at which career paths like-minded people are pursuing, the INFP’s job satisfaction is ultimately dependent upon the structure and values of the organization they find themselves aligned with. There are a few crucial components that the INFP requires from their workplace in order to stay satisfied and productive at work:

&nbsp;

What Every INFP Needs From Their Career:

&nbsp;

**Authenticity** | The INFP is essentially incapable of working at any place that they feel endorses corrupt or inauthentic values. A sales position at a crooked establishment would all but kill this principled type. They need to feel as though the work they’re doing is a genuine reflection of their own values, and that they are not ‘putting on a face’ to show up to work every day. This type needs to work for an organization that allows them to bring their genuine personality to the job.

**C****onnection And Belonging** | INFPs don’t want to be a faceless employee to their company—they wish to feel deeply connected to their workplace and the people who make it up. If this type doesn’t feel a personal sense of significance at work, they are unlikely to remain committed to their position for very long.

**Creative** **License** | Repeating dull or monotonous tasks is torturous for the INFP—this type thrives on the opportunity to create, invent and play with new ideas. To stay satisfied at work long-term, the INFP needs to be able to bring a creative flair to whatever they’re doing—whether it’s producing art or simply coming up with new ways of tackling existing problems in the workplace.

&nbsp;

**A Moderate Degree Of External Structure** | Though the INFP needs to maintain creative autonomy over their own work, they thrive best in environments that already have a moderate degree of external structure in place. They may work best under the mentorship of judger bosses, who are able to keep the INFP on track with big- picture goals, but also allow them to tackle problems creatively and autonomously.

Upon maturing and developing his or her inferior extroverted thinking, the INFP can make for an excellent entrepreneur. This type certainly possesses the vision, the passion and the commitment to make their own wildest dreams come true—but first they have to reach the point where they are able to harness extroverted thinking and handle the more mundane aspects of managing a business.

**The** **Feeling** **That** **The** **Work** **They’re** **Doing** **Matters** | The INFP has an incredibly difficult time staying motivated if they feel as though the work they’re doing isn’t giving back to others or the world around them in any meaningful way. This type is driven by the desire to help and heal the world around them—and they need a career that gives them at least some small means of doing so every day.

&nbsp;

## Strengths Of The INFP In The Workplace:

Once they find a workplace that suits them, the INFP makes for a focused, passionate and supremely loyal worker. They are inventive and motivated individuals who are genuinely willing to pour the whole of themselves into whichever position they take on. As colleagues, this type is known for going out of their way to make sure the workplace is a peaceful and harmonious place for everyone.

Some of the key strengths that INFPs bring to the workplace are as follows:

&nbsp;

INFPs are clever and analytical thinkers who can easily formulate creative solutions to complex problems.

INFPs genuinely care about others, and will naturally go out of their way to make coworkers and clients feel comfortable and understood.

&nbsp;

INFPs are highly invested workers who will pour their entire heart into any task they feel strongly about.

INFPs are incredibly creative workers who add an intriguing personal flair to just about everything they do.

INFPs are big-picture thinkers who intuitively perceive and understand the causes behind recurring problems.

INFPs are extremely determined workers who will stop at almost nothing to get an important job done.

INFPs have an intuitive knack for connecting with and deeply understanding others—which makes them naturals in any sort of ‘helping’ role.

INFPs are flexible and adaptable workers who adjust quickly to new situations and environments.

INFPs are highly articulate writers and speakers. They are able convey ideas concisely and powerfully, in a way that truly speaks to others.

INFPs see the potential in everyone they meet—which makes them natural motivators and mentors.

&nbsp;

## Challenges The INFP Faces In The Workplace:

Like any other type, INFPs face a unique set of challenges in the workplace. While they do make for loyal and passionate workers, this type tends to struggle with discipline and focus in the workplace. A few of the challenges INFPs may face in their professional lives are as follows:

&nbsp;

INFPs   work    best    when   they’re   inspired     and   may      routinely procrastinate the less interesting components of their jobs.

INFPs  may experience  difficulty prioritizing and  organizing their work, as they feel it interrupts their creative process.

INFPs  may  fail  to  advocate  or  speak  up  for  themselves  in  the workplace, because they don’t want to rock the boat.

&nbsp;

INFPs may be prone to taking on too much work themselves—rather than delegating it out to others—and bog themselves down with responsibility.

INFPs are highly sensitive to criticism and may struggle with receiving negative feedback in the workplace.

INFPs often dislike traditional hierarchies and may struggle to ‘lay down the law’ when they find themselves in positions of authority.

In management positions, INFPs are likely to dislike delivering negative feedback to others and may gloss over problems in favor of keeping the peace.

INFPs may wish to be self-employed but not want to deal with the administrative drudgeries of self-employment.

INFPs may struggle immensely to find a career that offers them the opportune mix of structure, community, creative freedom and meaning. They are likely to change careers multiple times throughout their young lives as they search for the absolute ideal job for themselves.
