Most people naturally assume that if their life is not going the way they want it to go, something outside of themselves must be preventing the improvement, for no one would deliberately hold their own success away. But while pointing the blame at others may feel better than assuming responsibility for unwanted conditions, there is a very big negative repercussion to believing that something outside of you is the reason for your own lack of success: _When you give the credit or the blame to another for your success or lack of it—you are powerless to make any change._

_ _

When you desire success, but—from your perspective—you are not currently experiencing it, at many deep levels of your Being you recognize that something is wrong. And as this strong feeling of personal discord magnifes your awareness that you are not getting what you want, it often sets into motion other counterproductive assumptions that evoke jealousy toward those who _are_ having more success; resentment at a myriad of people you would like to blame for your lack of success; or even self-denigration, which is the most painful and counterproductive assumption of all. And we submit that this uncomfortable upheaval is not only normal, but it is the perfect response to your feeling a lack of success.

_Your_ _emotional discomfort is a powerful indicator that something is very wrong._ You are meant to succeed, and failure _should_ feel bad to you. You are meant to be well, and sickness _should not_ be accepted. You are supposed to expand, and stagnation _is_ intolerable. Life is supposed to go well for you—and when it does not, there _is_ something wrong.

&nbsp;

But what is wrong is not that an injustice has occurred, or that the gods of good fortune are not focusing on you, or that someone else has received the success that should have been yours. What is wrong is that you are out of harmony with your own Being, with _who-you-really-are,_ with what life has caused you to ask for, with what you have expanded to, and with the ever-consistent _Laws of the Universe. What is wrong is not something that is outside of you over which you have no control. What is wrong is within you—and you <u>do </u>have control. And taking control is not diffcult to do once you understand the basis of <u>who-you-are </u>and the basics of the <u>Law of Attraction </u>and the value of your personal <u>Emotional Guidance System </u>that you were born with, which is always active, ever present, and easy to understand._
