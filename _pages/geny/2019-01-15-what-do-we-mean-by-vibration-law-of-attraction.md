When we speak of _vibration,_ we are actually calling your attention to the basis of your experience, for everything is actually _vibration ally_ based. We could use the word _Energy_ interchangeably, and there are many other synonyms in your vocabulary that accurately apply.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Most understand the vibrational characteristics of sound. Sometimes when the deep, rich bass notes of your musical instrumentation are played loudly, you can even _feel_ the vibrational nature of sound.

&nbsp;

We want you to understand that whenever you “hear” something, you are interpreting vibration into the sound you are hearing. What you hear is _your_ interpretation of vibration; what you hear is your _unique_ interpretation of vibration. Each of your physical senses of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching exist because everything in the Universe is vibrating and your physical senses are reading the vibrations and giving you sensory perception of the vibrations.

&nbsp;

So as you come to understand that you live in a pulsating, vibrating Universe of advanced harmonics, and that at the very core of your Being you are vibrating at what could only be described as perfection in vibrational balance and harmony, then you begin to understand _vibration_ in the way we are projecting it.

&nbsp;

_Everything_ _that exists, in your air, in your dirt, in your water, and in your bodies, is vibration in motion—and all of it is managed by the powerful <u>Law of Attraction.</u>_

&nbsp;

You could not sort it out if you wanted to. And there is no need for you to sort it out, because the _Law of Attraction_ is doing the sorting, continually bringing things of like vibrations together while things of different vibrational natures are being repelled.

&nbsp;

Your emotions, which really are the most powerful and important of your six physical vibrational interpreters, give you constant feedback about the harmonics of your current thoughts (vibrations) as they compare with the harmonics of your core vibrational state.

&nbsp;

The Non-Physical world is vibration.

The physical world that you know is vibration.

There is nothing that exists outside of this vibrational nature. There is nothing that is not managed by the _Law of Attraction._

_ _

Your understanding of vibration will help you to consciously bridge both worlds.

You do not have to understand your complex optic nerve or your primary visual cortex in order to see. You do not have to understand electricity to be able to turn on the light, and you do not have to understand vibrations in order to feel the difference between harmony and discord.

&nbsp;

_As you learn to accept your vibrational nature, and begin to consciously utilize your emotional vibrational indicators, you will gain conscious control of your personal creations and of the outcomes of your life experience._
