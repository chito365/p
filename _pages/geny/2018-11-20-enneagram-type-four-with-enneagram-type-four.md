# <u>Advice</u>

**For Fours**

  * Both of you are looking for the ideal partner who is going to make you feel whole and complete – and it will never happen until you EACH feel whole and complete within You may think “If only s/he morea little more like this and a little less like that, then I would be happy with him/her.” It won’t work. The Fourhabit of mind is to focus on what’s missing. Both of you have a deep fear of abandonment and rejection. Younotice flaws to perpetuate the underlying expectation of disappointment. Work on your own personal development and learn to how to appreciate what you DO have in each other that you won’t find in any othertype (see type Four description).
