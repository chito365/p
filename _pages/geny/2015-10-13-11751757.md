EMBEDDED SYSTEMS &#8211; Learn Computer Programming

An embedded system is a multi-agent system and [computer](www.oscarkemboi.xyz/?search=computer)system designed for specific control functions within a larger system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts.

By contrast, a general-purpose computer, such as a personal computer (PC), is designed to be flexible and to meet a wide range of end-user needs. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today examples of devices with embedded systems are telephone switches, mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), mp3 players, mobile phones, videogame consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, GPS, brushless DC motors, induction motors and DC motors.

Embedded systems contain processing cores that are either microcontrollers or digital signal processors (DSP). Embedded systems are created mainly with C and Assembly Language. I will come to programming languages later.
