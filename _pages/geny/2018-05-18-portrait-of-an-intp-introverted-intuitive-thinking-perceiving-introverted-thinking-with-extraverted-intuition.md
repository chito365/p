**_The_** **_Thinker_**

&nbsp;

As an INTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in primarily via your intuition.

&nbsp;

INTP&#8217;s live in the world of theoretical possibilities. They see everything in terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into. They live primarily inside their own minds, having the ability to analyze difficult problems, identify patterns, and come up with logical explanations. They seek clarity in everything, and are therefore driven to build knowledge. They are the &#8220;absent-minded professors&#8221;, who highly value intelligence and the ability to apply logic to theories to find solutions. They typically are so strongly driven to turn problems into logical explanations, that they live much of their lives within their own heads, and may not place as much importance or value on the external world. Their natural drive to turn theories into concrete understanding may turn into a feeling of personal responsibility to solve theoretical problems, and help society move towards a higher understanding.

&nbsp;

INTP’s value knowledge above all else. Their minds are constantly working to generate new theories, or to prove or disprove existing theories. They approach problems and theories with enthusiasm and skepticism, ignoring existing rules and opinions and defining their own approach to the resolution. They seek patterns and logical explanations for anything that interests them. They&#8217;re usually extremely bright, and able to be objectively critical in their analysis. They love new ideas, and become very excited over abstractions and theories. They love to discuss these concepts with others. They may seem &#8220;dreamy&#8221; and distant to others, because they spend a lot of time inside their minds musing over theories. They hate to work on routine things &#8211; they would much prefer to build complex theoretical solutions, and leave the implementation of the system to others. They are intensely interested in theory, and will put forth tremendous amounts of time and energy into finding a solution to a problem with has piqued their interest.

&nbsp;

INTP’s do not like to lead or control people. They&#8217;re very tolerant and flexible in most situations, unless one of their firmly held beliefs has been violated or challenged, in which case they may take a very rigid stance. The INTP is likely to be very shy when it comes to meeting new people. On the other hand, the INTP is very self-confident and gregarious around people they know well, or when discussing theories which they fully understand.

&nbsp;

The INTP has no understanding or value for decisions made on the basis of personal subjectivity or feelings. They strive constantly to achieve logical conclusions to

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

problems, and don&#8217;t understand the importance or relevance of applying subjective emotional considerations to decisions. For this reason, INTP’s are usually not in-tune with how people are feeling, and are not naturally well-equipped to meet the emotional needs of others.

&nbsp;

The INTP may have a problem with self-aggrandizement and social rebellion, which will interfere with their creative potential. Since their Feeling side is their least developed trait, the INTP may have difficulty giving the warmth and support that is sometimes necessary in intimate relationships. If the INTP doesn&#8217;t realize the value of attending to other people&#8217;s feelings, he or she may become overly critical and sarcastic with others. If the INTP is not able to find a place for themselves which supports the use of their strongest abilities, they may become generally negative and cynical. If the INTP has not developed their Sensing side sufficiently, they may become unaware of their environment, and exhibit weakness in performing maintenance-type tasks, such as bill-paying and dressing appropriately.

&nbsp;

For the INTP, it is extremely important that ideas and facts are expressed correctly and succinctly. They are likely to express themselves in what they believe to be absolute truths. Sometimes, their well thought-out understanding of an idea is not easily understandable by others, but the INTP is not naturally likely to tailor the truth so as to explain it in an understandable way to others. The INTP may be prone to abandoning a project once they have figured it out, moving on to the next thing. It&#8217;s important that the INTP place importance on expressing their developed theories in understandable ways. In the end, an amazing discovery means nothing if you are the only person who understands it.<!--nextpage-->

&nbsp;

The INTP is usually very independent, unconventional, and original. They are not likely to place much value on traditional goals such as popularity and security. They usually have complex characters, and may tend to be restless and temperamental. They are strongly ingenious, and have unconventional thought patterns which allow them to analyze ideas in new ways. Consequently, a lot of scientific breakthroughs in the world have been made by the INTP.

&nbsp;

The INTP is at his best when he can work on his theories independently. When given an environment which supports his creative genius and possible eccentricity, the INTP can accomplish truly remarkable things. These are the pioneers of new thoughts in our society.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Truth Seekers &#8211; they want to understand things by analyzing underlying principles and structures

&nbsp;Value knowledge and competence above all else

&nbsp;Have very high standards for performance, which they apply to themselves &nbsp;Independent and original, possibly eccentric

&nbsp;Work best alone, and value autonomy &nbsp;Have no desire to lead or follow

&nbsp;Dislike mundane detail

&nbsp;Not particularly interested in the practical application of their work &nbsp;Creative and insightful

&nbsp;Future-oriented

&nbsp;Usually brilliant and ingenious

&nbsp;Trust their own insights and opinions above others

&nbsp;Live primarily inside their own minds, and may appear to be detached and uninvolved with other people

&nbsp;

INTP’s have a special gift with generating and analyzing theories and possibilities to prove or disprove them. They have a great deal of insight and are creative thinkers, which allow them to quickly grasp complex abstract thoughts. They also have exceptional logical and rational reasoning skills, which allow them to thoroughly analyze theories to discover the Truth about them. Since the INTP is driven to seek clarity in the world, we have a happy match of desire and ability in this personality type. INTP’s will be happiest in careers which allow them a great deal of autonomy in which they can work primarily alone on developing and analyzing complex theories and abstractions, with the goal of their work being the discovery of a truth, rather than the discovery of a practical application.

&nbsp;

**I****N****T****P** **Relationships**

INTP’s live rich worlds inside their minds, which are full of imagination and excitement. Consequently, they sometimes find the external world pales in comparison. This may result in a lack of motivation to form and maintain relationships. INTP’s are not likely to have a very large circle of significant relationships in their lives. They&#8217;re much more likely to have a few very close relationships, which they hold in great esteem and with great affection. Since the INTP&#8217;s primary focus and attention is turned inwards, aimed towards seeking clarity from abstract ideas, they are not naturally tuned into others&#8217; emotional feelings and needs. They tend to be difficult to get to know well, and hold back parts of themselves until the other person has proven themselves &#8220;worthy&#8221; of hearing the INTP&#8217;s thoughts. Holding Knowledge and Brain Power above all else in importance, the INTP will choose to be around people who they consider to be intelligent. Once the INTP has committed themselves to a relationship, they tend to be very faithful and loyal, and form affectionate attachments which are pure and straight-forward. The INTP has no interest or understanding of game-playing with regards to relationships. However, if something happens which the INTP considers irreconcilable, they will leave the relationship and not look back.
