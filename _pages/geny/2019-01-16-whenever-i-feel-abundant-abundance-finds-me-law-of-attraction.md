When you make the conscious correlation between what you have been feeling and what is actualizing in your life experience, now you are empowered to make changes. If you are not making that correlation, and so continue to offer thoughts of lack about things you want, the things you want will continue to elude you.

&nbsp;

People, often, in this misunderstanding begin to assign power to things outside of themselves in order to explain why they are not thriving in the way they would like: “I’m not thriving because I was born into the wrong environment. I’m not thriving because my parents didn’t thrive, so they couldn’t teach me how to do it. I’m not thriving because those people over there are thriving, and they’re taking the resources that should have been mine. I’m not thriving because I was cheated,

&nbsp;

Because I’m not worthy, because I didn’t live the right way in a past life, because my government ignores my rights, because my husband doesn’t do his part . . . because, because, because.”

&nbsp;

And we want to remind you, your “not thriving” is only because you are offering a vibration that is different from the vibration of thriving. _You cannot feel poor (and vibrate poor) and thrive. Abundance cannot find you unless you offer a vibration of abundance._

_ _

Many ask, “But if I’m not thriving, then how in the world can I offer a vibration of thriving? Don’t I have to thrive before I can offer the vibration of thriving?” We agree that it is certainly easy to maintain a condition of thriving when it is already in your experience, because then all you have to do is notice the good that is coming and your observation of it will keep it coming. But if you are standing in the absence of something you want, you must find a way to feel the essence of it—even before it comes—or it cannot come.

&nbsp;

You cannot let your vibrational offering come only in response to _what-is_ and then ever change _what-is._ You must find a way of _feeling_ the excitement or satisfaction of your currently unrealized dreams before those dreams can become your reality. Find a way to deliberately imagine a scenario for the purpose of offering a vibration and for the purpose of the _Law of Attraction_ matching your vibration with a real-life manifestation. . . . _When you ask for the manifestation prior to the vibration, you ask the impossible. When you are willing to offer the vibration before the manifestation—all things are possible. It is <u>Law.</u>_
