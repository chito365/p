ife as an INFP isn’t all sunshine and roses. Though this type is passionate, creative and inspired at best, their emotional intensity has the potential to

lead them down some dark and dangerous paths. In the following chapter, we’ll explore the ‘dark side’ of the INFP personality type—what happens when their psychological defenses break down and a reliance on their inferior function manifests.

## How Your Greatest Strengths Are Also Your Greatest Weaknesses

To an extent, all personality traits exist on a spectrum. Unchecked self-interest turns into competitiveness. Unbridled passion bleeds into obsession. And with a personality as complex as the INFP’s, there are a seemingly infinite number of traits that can manifest in vastly different ways as this type moves through various levels of health.

Below, we’ll examine the various manifestations of some of the most common INFP traits as they pertain to an optimally healthy and an unhealthy version of the type. In the following descriptions, the word “Healthy” is interchangeable (but not synonymous) with the word “Mature” and the word “Unhealthy” is interchangeable (but not synonymous) with the word “Immature.”
