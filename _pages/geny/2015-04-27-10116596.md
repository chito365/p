collection

4. Model  
translation

5. Verification if not it returns to Model  
translation

6. Validation if not, it returns to model conceptualization or Data collection.

7. Experimental  
Design

8. Production runs  
and analysis

9.&nbsp; More runs? if not goes to Documentation else if yes it goes back to Experimental  
Design

10. Documentation  
and reporting
