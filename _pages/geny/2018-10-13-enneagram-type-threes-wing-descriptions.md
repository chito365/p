**Are you more like a Three with a Two-wing or a Three with a Four-wing? Read below to**  
**find out.**

## Type Three with a Two Wing (3w2)

**Positive:**  
• Helpful, Friendly, Generous  
• Tuned in to others, Charming  
• Perky, Vivacious  
• Gregarious – can seem Sevenish  
• Socially adept, Encouraging  
• Friendly, Generous, Warm  
• Can be outwardly emotional  
**Negative:**  
• Manipulative, Artificial quality  
• Flattering, Seductive, Suave

**Type Three with a Two Wing:** Threes with a Two wing (3w2s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Twos than of Fours (the other wing), although both wings (2 and 4) can influence  
their personality. 3w2s tend to be one of the most outgoing, self-confident (seemingly if not  
actually), charming, gregarious and socially adept of all the wing type combinations. They often  
seem like Sevens because they are vivacious, adventurous, friendly, full of energy and like to  
engage with others. Unlike Sevens though, 3w2s aren’t trying to escape from fear and self-doubt  
by being compulsively active. Nor are they nonconforming, outspoken and irreverent. Rather,  
they are more interested in recognition for their good works and admirable achievements that  
have a positive social perception. When healthy, 3w2s can be encouraging, motivating,  
bighearted and generous with their time, attention and money. They are tuned in to people and  
tend to be warmer and more openly sociable than 3w4s. They often have leadership qualities and  
work hard not only to make a name for themselves but to be of service to others. Sometimes  
their home life can suffer because they pour so much of their heart and soul into their work. Like  
2w3s, 3w2s can be seductive and flirtatious. They want to be desirable and may feel as though  
part of their value comes from being able to attract others.  
Negatively, they can have a big ego and alter their self-presentation to be popular. They  
want to be highly admired and even adored by people. They know how to turn on the charm and  
get others to like them. 3w2s are very competitive, although not outwardly so since they are  
aware of their reputation and how they are coming across to others. They can be boastful,  
manipulative, possessive and flattering. At their worst, they can be opportunistic and deceptive  
con-artists and psychopaths.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Three with a Four wing also  
(see below). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two  
descriptions. See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that  
difference might be.

## Type Three with a Four Wing (3w4)

**Positive:**  
• Career-oriented, introspective  
• Serious (can seem Oneish)  
• Hard working  
• Value comes from the quality of their work  
• More humanistic, imaginative  
• Intellectual, sensitive, creative  
• More self-analysis than 3w2s  
**Negative:**  
• Self-doubting, Self-conscious  
• Arrogant, Pretentious, Moody

**Type Three with a Four Wing:** Threes with a Four wing (3w4s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Fours than of Twos (the other wing), although both wings (4 and 2) can influence  
their personality. 3w4s are usually more introspective, sensitive, self-aware and serious-minded  
than 3w2s. They are still charming and charismatic with a winning personality like all Threes but  
there is also a more subdued, self-questioning, contemplative side to their persona. They derive  
a great deal of their self-esteem from their work, which 3w4s want to be an authentic expression  
of who they are. They are competitive but it’s more about competing with themselves and living  
up to their high ideals than about competing with other people. 3w4s often seem like Ones  
because they can be quite task-focused, conscientious, idealistic and, at times, perfectionistic.  
They also take great pride in their work and want to be known for their competence, integrity,  
professionalism and meaningful self-expression. 3w4s seek to understand themselves more than  
3w2s and are often drawn to inner work or artistic exploration as means of self-analysis and selfawareness.  
Some intuitive 3w4s often switch careers and pursue more humanistic work, such as  
mentoring, teaching or counseling, if they’ve had some kind of spiritual awakening experience or  
life trauma that caused them to re-evaluate their priorities.  
Negatively, 3w4s can have tremendous inner tension trying to reconcile their dual  
personality. On the one hand, they have great ambition and drive like all Threes. They want to  
shine and appear to have it all together. On the other hand, they can lapse into self-doubt and  
self-questioning, so characteristic of Fours. At those times they can be very moody, private and  
self-conscious. At times they can be haughty, pretentious, and arrogant (like unhealthy Threes)  
and at other times they can be self-absorbed, self-contemptuous and depressive (like unhealthy  
Fours). This person can therefore seem at odds with him or herself and is one reason why they  
are often drawn to inner work mentioned earlier.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Three with a Two wing also  
(see above). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two  
descriptions. See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that  
difference might be.
