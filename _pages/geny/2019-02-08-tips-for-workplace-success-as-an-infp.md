#### 1.      Consider a career that emphasis your auxiliary function.

INFPs are constantly engaging their introverted feeling. They feel the weight of their own emotions as well as the weight of their loved ones’ emotions—many even report feeling deeply for the homeless people they pass on their way to work each morning.

Because they are so emotionally aware, many INFPs are drawn to helping or caretaking roles. However, these roles may also be quick to burn the INFP out. This type already lives in a feeling-laden world— some report that it’s a relief to have a profession that forces them to put their feelings aside for several hours a day!

While an entirely heartless profession is unlikely to jive with the INFP’s values, this type may want to consider choosing a profession that highlights their auxiliary extroverted intuition. Careers that call upon them to think outside the box, explore possibilities and engage their creativity

&nbsp;

are likely to be energizing for the INFP. These types of professions allow them to play upon their strengths without depleting their emotional reserves.

#### 2.      Accept that your ideal workplace may be a place that you create, rather than find.

INFPs desperately wish to find a working environment that perfectly matches their values and allows them to work at their own pace. But the more jobs they cycle through, the more the INFP is likely to realize that good work environments aren’t always found—they’re made. And that perhaps the reason the INFP hasn’t found their ideal environment yet is because they haven’t put the work into cultivating it.

&nbsp;

#### 3.      Create a workplace structure that necessitates delegation.

Rather than hoping colleagues will jump in to help out with tasks that need handling, the INFP may benefit from scheduling a weekly meeting in which the tasks for the week are regularly divided and conquered. This will relieve the INFP of needing to constantly assign tasks to others, and provide a steady stream of productive communication among team members.

&nbsp;

#### 4.      Re-frame criticism in order to accept it more readily.

When receiving constructive criticism from colleagues or bosses, keep in mind that they are providing you with feedback because they value your work and see opportunities for growth in you. Rather than looking at it as an attack, recognize that criticism is often a thinking type’s way of expressing the potential they see in you—just like you see the potential in everyone else.

&nbsp;

#### 5.      Surround yourself with coworkers whose strengths are your weaknesses.

Some of the greatest assets any INFP has in the workplace are their colleagues. The INFP is a natural team player and they are likely to benefit immensely from combining their passionate ideals with the detail- orientation and follow-through of sensing, judging types. By surrounding themselves with those whose strengths are their weakness (and vice versa), the INFP will set themselves up for professional success.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### 6.      Hold yourself publically accountable for following through on projects.

Since disciplining themselves to follow through on long-term goals may be difficult for the INFP, they may elect to hold themselves publically accountable for completing mini-tasks. Because the INFP hates letting others down, he or she is likely to feel particularly motivated to complete a task if others are holding them accountable for it.

&nbsp;

#### 7.      Set and maintain clear boundaries between your work life and your home life.

Once the INFP does find a position that they’re passionate about, they are prone to going all in and devoting the whole of themselves to their work. This may seem appealing at first but it is an incredibly quick way for the INFP to burn themselves out, particularly in helping or caretaking roles. This type functions best in the workplace once they learn to set clear boundaries between their work and home life—and can mentally detach from each environment when they’re engaged with the other.

&nbsp;

#### 8.      Make self-care a deliberate part of your workday.

Because INFPs tend to gravitate towards emotionally intense work environments, they need to remember that they cannot give from an empty vessel. Introverted feeling is a function that needs replenishing—through reflection, relaxation or any other forms of self-care that center and balance the INFP. The more this type incorporates self-care practices into their workday, the more effective of a worker they will be in the short- term—and the less likely they will be to burn out in the long-term.

&nbsp;

#### 9.      Don’t try to fit a square peg into a round hole.

** **

While there are many, many steps the INFP can take to make any workplace they end up in a happy and healthy place to be, it’s also important to distinguish between which work environments are challenging and which are simply the wrong choice.

Many young INFPs may find themselves following the career paths that are expected of them by parents or mentors, rather than the career paths they actually want to pursue. And for a type like the INFP—who does their best and

&nbsp;

brightest work when inspired—being on a path that doesn’t excite them is a waste of their immeasurable potential.
