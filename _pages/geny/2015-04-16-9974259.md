<font face="Verdana">Internet Protocol Security (IPSec). IPSec provides encryption and/or authentication at the IP packet level. However, IPSec is often used in a way that only guarantees authenticity of two communicating hosts, not of the users. As a practical matter, IPSec usually requires low-level support from the operating system (which not all implement) and an additional keyring server that must be configured. Since IPSec can be used as a &#8220;tunnel&#8221; to secure packets belonging to multiple users and multiple hosts, it is especially useful for building a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and connecting a remote machine. As of this time, it is much less often used to secure communication from individual clients to servers. The new version of the Internet Protocol, IPv6, comes with IPSec &#8220;built in,&#8221; but IPSec also works with the more common IPv4 protocol. Note that if you use IPSec, don&#8217;t use the encryption mode without the authentication, because the authentication also acts as integrity protection.<br />Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / TLS. SSL/TLS works over TCP and tunnels other protocols using TCP, adding encryption, authentication of the server, and optional authentication of the client (but authenticating clients using SSL/TLS requires that clients have configured X.509 client certificates, something rarely done). SSL version 3 is widely used; TLS is a later adjustment to SSL that strengthens its security and improves its flexibility. Currently there is a slow transition going on from SSLv3 to TLS, aided because implementations can easily try to use TLS and then back off to SSLv3 without user intervention. Unfortunately, a few bad SSLv3 implementations cause problems with the backoff, so you may need a preferences setting to allow users to skip using TLS if necessary. Don&#8217;t use SSL version 2, it has some serious security weaknesses.<br />SSL/TLS is the primary method for protecting http (web) transactions. Any time you use an &#8220;https://&#8221; URL, you&#8217;re using SSL/TLS. Other protocols that often use SSL/TLS include POP3 and IMAP. SSL/TLS usually use a separate TCP/IP port number from the unsecured port, which the IETF is a little unhappy about (because it consumes twice as many ports; there are solutions to this). SSL is relatively easy to use in programs, because most library implementations allow programmers to use operations similar to the operations on standard sockets like SSL_connect(), SSL_write(), SSL_read(), etc. A widely used OSS/FS implementation of SSL (as well as other capabilities) is OpenSSL, available at</font> [<font face="Verdana">http://www.openssl.org</font>](http://www.openssl.org)<font face="Verdana">.<br />OpenPGP and S/MIME. There are two competing, essentially incompatible standards for securing email: OpenPGP and S/MIME. OpenPHP is based on the PGP application; an OSS/FS implementation is GNU Privacy Guard from</font> [<font face="Verdana">http://www.gnupg.org</font>](http://www.gnupg.org)<font face="Verdana">. Currently, their certificates are often not interchangeable; work is ongoing to repair this.<br />SSH. SSH is the primary method of securing &#8220;remote terminals&#8221; over an internet, and it also includes methods for tunelling X Windows sessions. However, it&#8217;s been extended to support single sign-on and general secure tunelling for TCP streams, so it&#8217;s often used for securing other data streams too. The most popular implementation of SSH is OpenSSH</font> [<font face="Verdana">http://www.openssh.com</font>](http://www.openssh.com)<font face="Verdana">, which is OSS/FS. Typical uses of SSH allows the client to authenticate that the server is truly the server, and then the user enters a password to authenticate the user (the password is encrypted and sent to the other system for verification). Current versions of SSH can store private keys, allowing users to not enter the password each time. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, SSH records keying information about servers it talks to; that means that typical use of SSH is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack during the very first connection, but it can detect problems afterwards. In contrast, SSL generally uses a certificate authority, which eliminates the first connection problem but requires special setup (and payment!) to the certificate authority.<br />Kerberos. Kerberos is a protocol for single sign-on and authenticating users against a central authentication and key distribution server. Kerberos works by giving authenticated users &#8220;tickets&#8221;, granting them access to various services on the network. When clients then contact servers, the servers can verify the tickets. Kerberos is a primary method for securing and supporting authentication on a LAN, and for establishing shared secrets (thus, it needs to be used with other algorithms for the actual protection of communication). Note that to use Kerberos, both the client and server have to include code to use it, and since not everyone has a Kerberos setup, this has to be optional &#8211; complicating the use of Kerberos in some programs. However, Kerberos is widely used.</font>
