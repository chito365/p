In the unlikely event you have betrayed an INFJ, cut deeply through their hearts then watch out &#8211;

&nbsp;

<span class="fbUnderline"><strong>Of course, everything below is &#8216;worst case under-developed&#8217; INFJ anger cases. It isn&#8217;t what INFJ&#8217;s do all the time. It is, extremely rare.</strong></span>

&nbsp;

Most have the patience of an iceberg waiting for hell to freeze over. Or a turn the other cheek style. But for those of you who want some insight into the darker, shadier side of an INFJ &#8230;venture down below, i dare you.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&#8212;

&nbsp;

**INFJ Anger style in &#8220;Rare&#8221; form:** The incorruptible ninja on a vendetta:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It means facing your fears and exposing the grittiness of your own human existence. Sound familiar INFJ? Okay, it sounds like martyr-dom and yes, it is. An INFJ knows ALL about martyrdom.

&nbsp;

**In extremely threatening cases,** an INFJ can go all angry ninja style on anybody&#8217;s arse. And i mean emotionally. They will cut you up and hang you out to dry. Emotionally. That is the key word here.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

First, the light: He we won&#8217;t stop until he&#8217;s wasted your emotional landscape, and neither will we. INFj&#8217;s at their weakest or best can be like double edged swords, yes we can see deep into people&#8217;s hearts, their motivations their good qualities, mirror their thoughts, actions and their desires to bring you relief or joy. INFJ&#8217;s listen not only with their ears, but with their heart, they can process and nurture people&#8217;s good qualities instinctively and mirror your what you want to hear. They are capable of forgiveness even of those with heinous crimes on their records, because yes &#8211; they know instinctively that everybody is human, all of us are interconnected and we all make mistakes, an INFJ has an uncanny ability to recognize that everybody is just a mirror of themselves. The best INFJ&#8217;s carry a karmic awareness at all times.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

With that knowledge they back it up like a hard drive. They remember. How they use that information, is up to them. That choice, is what makes them grow or go backwards.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

God forbid anybody come across an INFJ, hell or highwater because once you cross them &#8211; at best they will drop you like a hot pan and dissappear regardless of how long you&#8217;ve known them. At worst, be prepared for having all your insecurities and fears gutted and exposed. And they make sure you remember. They can dive deep into your heart to inspire you, but like that double edged sword they can cut straight into your heart with their words. They tell you the truth exactly as it is, whilst you are still grappling with the fact they knew how you felt all along, they expose all your ugliest motivations to air and for all to see. INFJ&#8217;s are adept at understanding the language of the human heart and what it wants and needs on an intangible level. They are expert emotional anthropologists. They understand boundaries and will not tell people how you feel, what is on your mind. This is because they know this information is precious, of course&#8230; until the shit hits the fan so to speak and then, they reveal everything about you. The ugly you. Every. Ugly. Detail.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They get under your skin and let loose slowly and methodically (yep, there&#8217;s that organization in action) anything they know about your weaknesses, everything they use turns it a kind of melodramatic piece of theatre relaying everything from your sexual indiscretions, faults, lack of listening skills and weaving it expertly by making sure every one of your emotional weaknesses are exploited. They hone in on your fears at the present moment and creatively exploit them for full effect, targeting fears, anxieties, guilt and expertly play them like a symphony. They understand the darkness in themselves and they recognize it in you.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Hell hath no fury like an INFJ scorned. Subtle, slow and insidioius is the scorned style of an INFJ. They can get creative with their scorn &#8211; they might have the dignity and coldness of a queen while they exploit your weaknesses. They personally tailor each and every remark for full emotional effect. They may tell you calmly and caustically why you cheated them and explain your insecurities in front of a large group of intimate friends whilst you sweat, hiding their motives behind dry wit and humour. They will adjust their level of scorn for whatever is appropriate for your character. If it&#8217;s a quick, derisive comment or a long confession of your insecurities &#8211; they will know which button to press to get to your heart. If it&#8217;s guilt they want to summon, they know what to say to make you feel it, they&#8217;ll remember an event or a whisper of an insecurity you have and they will bring it up. They remember the nuances in your dialogue, your emotional landscape &#8211; they remember your weaknesses and in an organized (judging) manner, categorically shoot each and every one of them down till they are satisfied you have sated their need for justice.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The scariness (or genius) of an INFJ however lies in the fact that they know how to adjust the temperature of their perceived hurt so that the other person feels the full effect of their remarks. Just as they can easily take the emotional temperature of a room just by walking into it, they know that getting completely angry is ineffective. So they manage their delivery intuitively, depending on your character so that the recipient has no room to retaliate &#8211; an INFJ instincitively knows if they expose a certain insecurity in you and say something softly, it is more effective than going completely a-wohl. They skirt over your anger and any issues they know will completely provoke you to not listening at all. They want to expose the truth, come hell or high water and if that means you feel reduced to something like a small child &#8211; totally exposed and a little humiliated, so be it. They will broach the topic carefully, and then caustically add something they know you will feel weakened by but will not be able to retaliate to because the topic for you is so personal. It is completely tactical. They want to expose you remember, so they think carefully about the delivery of a remark and it&#8217;s intention before it comes out.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You know that secret you told them when you first met them with an open heart and open mind? They will remember it, bring it up and flippantly tell you they weren&#8217;t really listening, and they didn&#8217;t really care for it if that&#8217;s what it takes to hurt you.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The purpose? The truth of course. The phrase, &#8216;Shed light on your sorry ass&#8217;, has never been more apt.&nbsp;
