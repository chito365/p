Friends, i really thought if Artificial Intelligence 1 is really difficult to fiqure out. obviously, it is composed of complex English definitions which are tricky to gram or understand.

It&#8217;s quite appealing since we managed to do the &#8220;tricky&#8221; subject. Hope my you are not laughing. Back to serious business now:

Here are some major definitions i came across while revising. Optimization problem &#8211; problem where the path to the goal is irrelevant. State Space Landscape &#8211; evaluation of agent function with state.

&nbsp;Simulated annealing- Slightly improving on hill climbing by introducing randomness and combination. Knowledge base Agent &#8211; agent whose knowledge is not specific. &#8211; Knowledge based agent can combine general knowledge with the current percepts meaning can reason out. &#8211; kb has capacity to infer hidden space. Key Words are:

&nbsp;1. Knowldge representation.&nbsp;

2. Reasoning.&nbsp;

3. Learning new knowledge. Entailment:- is the the idea that a sentense or assertion follows logically from another sentence.&nbsp;

Completeness &#8211; algorithm is complete if it can derive any sentence entailed.

Horn clause: is a disjunction of literals of which at most one is positive.&nbsp;

Propositional Logic &#8211; lacks the expressive power to describe an environment. Advantage of the fast order logic: it has better expressive power than the proportional logic.

&nbsp;Ontological commitment:- is what the logic assumes about the nature of reality.&nbsp;

Arity &#8211; number of arguments in a relation. Atomic Sentences: is a predicate symbol depending on the clarity sentences, constructed using logical connectiveness.

Bless!
