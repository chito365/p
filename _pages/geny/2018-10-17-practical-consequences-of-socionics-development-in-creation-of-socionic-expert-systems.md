The human civilization enters a new phase of its development, in which information  
technologies, such as Internet, are determining. Socionics, in turn, offers psycho-informational  
technologies, which allow human consciousness to be on the same level with achievements of  
information and electronic technologies. It is known that when human thinking is behind technical  
development of a society this result in huge quantity of social problems. Being an independent  
organization, the International Socionic institute is open for cooperation with state, public and private  
structures in training socionic technologies and their practical application. Existing and created  
socionic technologies stimulate, in turn, development of new information technologies, and this  
process goes with acceleration. It is obviously, that societies, countries, states fully using socionic  
methods and technologies, receive significant advantage against sociums and states not using them.  
The countries and societies, which could not or do not want to use socionic methods, can lose in due  
course their advantage. At the same time for the developing countries, for the countries experiencing  
the period of reforms, socionic technologies can become that real tool, which will help to make  
qualitative jump in all spheres of activity of the man.
