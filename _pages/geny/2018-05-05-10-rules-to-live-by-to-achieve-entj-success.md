  1. Feed Your Strengths! Give yourself every opportunity to show others your appreciation of a situation and how you could see it through to a good Take charge where you can make it count.
  2. Face Your Weaknesses! Understand you have limits Your careful world view is not the whole deal. How things look and feel may not concern you, but they concern many others. Try and allow such things to be and learn from them.
  3. Talk Time to Find Out How Others Really You need to drive past your thoughts with others and let their appreciations of a situation reach you at a deeper level. It will then be possible for you to take account of their needs as real world objectives which if included in your ideas will bring greater harmony and quality to life and relationships.
  4. Take Time Out To Let The Whole Situation Speak To Don&#8217;t dismiss those abstract and seemingly hard to understand or bothersome aesthetic and feeling judgments coming from others or from inside yourself. Drop everything for a while, stop thinking and worrying and just relax into those ideas and let them speak to you. Perhaps they can be accommodated, perhaps something is hiding in there which offers a new way
  5. When You Get Upset, You Your energy and rational understandings are strong assets, but can be very harmful if they turn against you and leave you with nothing but emotions you cannot deal with. Remember that others cannot always be expected to fall into your ways of seeing, and when your drive to make them do so fails you will suffer feelings of resentment and even abandonment. You cannot deal with the world like this. Moderate your ideas, allow others their spaces, and you will grow.
  6. Respect your need for intellectual Don&#8217;t expect yourself to be a &#8220;touchy-feely&#8221; or &#8220;warm-fuzzy&#8221; person. Realize that your most ardent bonds with others will start with the head, rather than the heart. Be aware of other&#8217;s emotional needs, and express your genuine love and respect for them in terms that are real to YOU. Be yourself.
  7. Be Accountable for Don&#8217;t blame the problems in your life on other people. Look inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.
  8. Be Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.
  9. Take a Positive Approach to Differences in Don&#8217;t distress yourself and others by dwelling on what seem to be their limitations. They need you to guide them and you need them to see things through. Try and recognize who can perform the most ably within certain fields outside &nbsp;your own competence. Let the feelings of others become a strength rather than a hindrance to you.
