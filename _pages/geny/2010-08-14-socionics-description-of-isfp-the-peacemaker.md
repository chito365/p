<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><b>Sensory-Ethical Intratim &#8211; ISFp (The Peacemaker)</b>&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><i>Based upon original work by Victor Gulenko with some alterations</i>&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><a class="active-text" title="More about ISFps" href="https://www.afriqueunique.org/?s=ISFP">ISFps<img src="http://www.socionics.com/prof/common/graph/q-mark.gif" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;often have a characteristic stout or chubby, rounded figure. They often have short legs and a bouncy gait, giving the impression of a big springy ball. Their faces are usually smooth and round without any obvious projections. In moments of passionate conversation they can often swallow air like a fish. When ISFps try to explain things, they can move their eyebrows considerably.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ISFps generally appear to be soft-hearted, but can become quite assertive if required. Their facial expression can change suddenly and unexpectedly from friendly one to a stern one, especially when they wish to distance themselves psychologically from someone. ISFps are often inclined to give advise concerning will power and initiative.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ISFps have a well developed aesthetic taste. Their clothes are usually neat, colourful and radiate a warm, comfortable feeling. They like to touch things in order to appreciate their physical qualities. When interacting with others ISFps try to maintain a closeness. They are often outwardly sociable, charming and friendly. They know well how to endear themselves to others and how to make people trust them. They prefer to interact in a democratic fashion, avoiding the spotlight.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ISFps do not usually try to push friendships. If they feel that a person does not want to establish contact with them they do not insist. They usually make just one attempt and if it is not successful they hardly ever try again. They maintain contact only with people that they find interesting. ISFps find it fairly difficult to interact with people that they dislike, even if it goes against their interests. In these situations they lose their personal magnetism, and their speech may become unintelligible.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ISFps enjoy gathering and sharing interacting facts and news. However, they always add a certain degree of colour to their narrative hoping to make it more interesting. This is the reason that ISFps are rarely caught telling a story the same way twice. They can easily talk about a single subject for a considerable amount of time, especially about their recent experiences. They also like to read a variety of newspapers.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ISFps do not like to unload their problems on others. When asked &#8220;How are you?&#8221; they usually reply that they are fine regardless of weather they are or not. ISFps do not like to make promises. If someone asks them for their help they will often reply &#8220;I cannot promise but I will try&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;If I can&#8230;&#8221; If they were not able to fulfil a promise they will continually apologise until they feel that they have been forgiven.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ISFps have a strong desire to experience as much as they can and to enjoy themselves as much as possible. They love spending time and having fun with their friends, often joking and playing pranks. They do not like to be the centre of attention, but they also do not like to be too far away from where it is all happening. ISFps behaviour can be so independent and original that they may confuse and bewilder other people. Because of this people can consider ISFps to be light-minded.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ISFps can usually only be productive when working for themselves. In all other cases it is rare for them to work hard. They try their best to avoid strenuous physical exercises wherever possible, unless it is in the course of a particular sporting&nbsp;<a class="active-text" title="More about activity" href="http://www.socionics.com/rel/act.htm">activity<img src="http://www.socionics.com/prof/common/graph/q-mark.gif" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;that they enjoy.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">Another behavioural pattern peculiar to ISFps is their tendency to try and stay in the middle. To be neither the best or to be the worst. This is the reason that they do not like to openly criticise people and do not get involved in confrontations. ISFps always try to keep well away from bosses and other authoritative figures. They do not like briefings and other boring business meetings. They try to negotiate on an informal level using only safe and reliable acquaintances. ISFps try to maintain peaceful relations with everybody.&nbsp;</span>
