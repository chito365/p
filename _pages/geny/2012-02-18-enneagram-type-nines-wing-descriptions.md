# Enneagram type Nine’s Wing Descriptions

**Are you more like a Nine with an Eight wing or a Nine with a One wing? Read below to find out.**

## Type Nine with an Eight Wing (9w8)

**Positive:**  
• Strong Willpower, Endurance  
• Enjoy socializing/good times  
• Like routines but occasionally seek an adventurous change  
• Like to work with people  
• Make good, caring leaders  
• Sensual, Independent  
**Negative:**  
• Stubborn, Blunt, Lustful  
• Bad Temper, Antiauthoritarian

**Type Nine with an Eight Wing:** Nines with an Eight wing (9w8s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Eights than of Ones (the other wing), although both wings (8 and 1) can influence  
their personality. 9w8s tend to be more adventurous, outgoing, assertive, antiauthoritarian and  
to-the-point than 9w1s. They are also more accepting of people just the way they are in  
comparison to 9w1s. They love to have a good time, have a great sense of humor, and are  
usually more sociable than 9w1s. Healthy 9w8s are dynamic and self-motivated. They like  
having their comfortable rituals, routines and habits, like all Nines, but their zest for life causes  
them to seek out new adventures and opportunities to break up their habitual routines every once  
in a while for a change of pace. They often like to travel, for example. Healthy 9w8s also can get  
things done with their excellent willpower, endurance and perseverance. 9w8s like to get out and  
connect with people in the world. 9w8s can be both powerful and gentle, active and receptive,  
strong and tender. Their Eight wing can give 9w8s a stronger sense of self, direction and purpose  
in their life than the One wing does for 9w1s.  
Negatively, 9w8s can vacillate between being confrontational and conciliatory, passive and  
aggressive. Nines are generally peace loving and don’t like to fight but the Eight part of them,  
when angered, won’t back down as easily as a 9w1 might. Most of the time 9w8s are easy-going  
and mild-mannered but they can also have bad tempers occasionally and be more stubborn and  
defensive than 9w1s. What sets a 9w8 off the most is having someone mess with their  
comfortable habits and well-being. Then they can be surprisingly blunt, rude or cold as ice.  
Some 9w8s can be so stubborn and defensive that they will refuse to listen to anyone who might  
threaten their safe, comfortable routines. Sometimes 9w8s are overly sensual and lustful due to  
the 8 wing. This can cause them to lose their focus on their life goals.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Nine with a One wing also (see  
below). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions.  
See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference  
might be.

## Type Nine with a One Wing (9w1)

**Positive:**

• Highly Principled, Hardworking  
• Orderly, Moral, Nonjudgmental  
• Strong sense of purpose and an ideal vision of a peaceful world  
• Imaginative, Creative, Dreamy  
• Modest, Friendly, Composed  
• Superb at nonverbal rapport

**Negative:**

• Self-critical, Self-righteous  
• Obsessive/Compulsive, Aloof

**Type Nine with a One Wing:** Nines with a One wing (9w1s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Ones than of Eights (the other wing), although both wings (1 and 9) can influence  
their personality. 9w1s tend to be more idealistic, emotionally reserved, and compliant than  
9w8s. They are often well-liked, well-behaved children. While 9w1s are friendly and personable  
there is also a seriousness of purpose about them. They feel a strong inner desire to be of  
service and to be of help to others. They have a vision of an ideal world and strive to create it  
(although they can sometimes get caught up in nonessential activities and unproductive  
busyness, which frustrates them). They want to contribute to everyone’s welfare but sometimes  
find it hard to live up to their own high expectations of themselves. They can be highly principled  
and virtuous, ethical behavior is important to them. 9w1s with a spiritual bent often make good  
therapists, healers, counselors, life coaches or ministers because of their ability to listen  
nonjudgmentally and their desire to inspire, heal and uplift people.  
Negatively, 9w1s can be self-critical, emotionally inhibited and perfectionistic, or severely selfneglectful  
if very unhealthy. While they accept other people’s imperfections they can have a hard  
time accepting their own. 9w1’s sense of purpose can be at odds with their concern for propriety,  
doing the right thing and fitting in. Oftentimes their own long range goals (if they know them,  
another problem for 9w1s!) get put on the back burner as they tend to the needs of others. They  
can get frustrated with themselves because they never get around to fulfilling their own needs.  
9w1s can easily mistaken themselves for 2w1s, especially if they are extroverted and energetic  
9w1s. It is not uncommon for 9w1s to let themselves become overlooked and unacknowledged  
servers of others’ needs. In relationships they can give too much but then feel resentful and  
taken advantage of. While 9w1s and 9w8s are both easy-going and pleasant most of the time,  
9w1s tend to restrain their anger more than 9w8s. 9w1s are more likely to become quietly  
indignant and smolder inwardly when mad rather than yell or lose control and make a scene like  
9w8s might. Some 9w1s can be highly active but somewhat emotionally detached from others,  
preferring to stay uninvolved lest they get sucked into doing something they don’t want to do and  
not being able to say no. While still being kind-hearted and good-natured, occasionally 9w1s can  
feel slightly smug and morally superior to others because of their strong religious beliefs about  
the “errant ways” of other people.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Nine with an Eight wing also (see  
above). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions.  
See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference  
might be.
