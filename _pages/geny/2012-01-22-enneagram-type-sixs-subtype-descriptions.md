Last time we had explanation of [the Enneagram Type Six’s Wing Descriptions](https://www.afriqueunique.org/enneagram-type-sixs-wing-descriptions/).

Today we are goong to look at Enneagram Type Six’s Subtype Descriptions. Which subtype are you?

## Type #6 Self-Preservation Subtype

Can resemble 2s because they are warm, friendly, affable, affectionate and can be flattering and  
ingratiating  
Tend to be the most domestic of the three type 6 subtypes  
Most Self-Preservation 6s are more phobic than counterphobic  
**Positive/Enhancing:**  
• Witty and very genuine  
• Want the best for everyone else as well as themselves  
• Tactful with good manners and a gracious way with people  
• Responsible, loyal and committed, they stand by their friends and those they love  
• Often focus on maintaining their home and the stability of their home life  
• Consider their home as somewhat like a castle, island, fortress or barrier of safety to  
protect them against the dangers of the outside world  
**Negative/Depleting:**

• Tend to be the most outwardly nervous, anxious, dependent and needy of the type 6  
subtypes  
• Their underlying fear is that they won’t be able to take care of themselves, won’t have the  
inner resources, capability, power or life skills to manage if something goes wrong  
• Tend to worry and fret a great deal, especially about financial matters and their ability to  
survive  
• Analyze decisions to death before making them to avoid making mistakes or jeopardizing  
their safety  
• Look to trusted others for reassurance and protection rather than to themselves  
• Overly concerned about how authority figures perceive them; feel the need to be well liked  
by them  
• Can project their own unowned power onto another and then see that person as a threat  
• Can develop theories about people’s negative moods or hostile intentions which are totally  
off  
• Subconsciously act warm and friendly towards others to disarm potential hostility  
• Can put themselves down, use humor or charm as a way of diffusing someone’s perceived  
power  
• Can be ingratiating and flattering (like 2s) to win other people’s affections (and ensure  
their survival)  
• Can be self-deprecating, act vulnerable and bid to be rescued (like 4s)  
• If fearful of their future safety, they can argue with their partner over money  
• Can have anticipatory anxiety and fearful fantasies of worst-case scenarios  
• At worst,

• Expect to be abandoned at any time and are terrified of having no support so they stay in  
bad situations  
• Can be depressed, paranoid and aggressive toward the very people they are looking to for  
security

## Type #6 Sexual Subtype

Tend to be the most openly defiant of authority of the three type 6 subtypes  
Counterphobic Sexual 6s can resemble 8s; they confront their fears, talk tough and take risks  
Phobic Sexual 6s can resemble 4s; they can be seductive, helpless or coquettish to win people’s  
affections  
**Positive/Enhancing:**  
• Are goal-oriented, hard-working and energetic  
• Keep themselves physically strong and/or physically attractive  
• Lead disciplined lives that allow them to feel empowered and secure  
• Can also be creative (somewhat like 4s) since they have a rich imagination and an eye for  
beauty  
**Negative/Depleting: (for Sexual 6s that Protect Themselves with Strength):**

• Try to hide their fears behind exaggerated strength (especially counterphobic 6s,  
especially men)  
• Have a lot of self-doubt about their sexual attractiveness and desirability  
• Fear they would not be loved if others knew how much self-doubt they have  
• Act strong and/or seductive but really feel insecure, fearful and self-doubting.  
• Can have explosive emotional reactions when their connection with important others is  
threatened  
• Men in particular can try to give the impression of being macho, virile, manly and tough  
• Can appear intimidating, arrogant or callous as a way to get people to not mess with them  
and, thus, not threaten or scare them. They’re actually afraid of scaring themselves but  
don’t realize it  
• They think the threat is “out there” so they take on a strong persona to match any  
perceived threat  
• They can invite aggressive reactions to their belligerent reactions  
• Test others to appraise their character, inner strength and fortitude (like 8s do)  
**Negative/Depleting: (for Sexual 6s that Protect Themselves with Beauty):**  
• Try to hide their fears behind a mask of beauty (especially phobic 6s, especially women)  
• Can have the vanity of Sexual 3s and try to become the “ideal man” or “ideal woman”  
• Sexual 6s know they are hiding but are afraid to take of their mask  
• Female sexual 6s, especially, play up their attractiveness as a way of attracting a partner  
• Allow people to mistake their outer appearance and sexual appeal for their inner self  
• Can be tough also but prefer to use their beauty to protect themselves

• Subconsciously rationalize that if you love them for their beauty then when you find out  
what a nervous wreck underneath they are you might still keep them because you love  
them already anyway  
• At worst, both “Strength” and “Beauty” Sexual 6s can be obsessively paranoid and  
depressive  
• Fear their erratic, emotionally reactive defiance and lashing out has ruined their intimate  
connections  
• Can be self-destructive, impulsive and aggressive yet terrified of being without support

their mind to get guidance and support when making decisions
