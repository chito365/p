ROI 1  
Return on Investment (ROI)  
Prepared by Sarah Major  
What is ROI?  
Return on investment (ROI) is a measure that investigates the amount of  
additional profits produced due to a certain investment. Businesses use  
this calculation to compare different scenarios for investments to see  
which would produce the greatest profit and benefit for the company.  
However, this calculation can also be used to analyze the best scenario for  
other forms of investment, such as if someone wishes to purchase a car,  
buy a computer, pay for college, etc.  
Simple ROI Formula  
The simplest form of the formula for ROI involves only two values: the cost  
of the investment and the gain from the investment. The formula is as  
follows:  
��� (%) = ���� ���� ���������� − ���� �� ����������  
���� �� ����������  
×100  
The ratio is multiplied by 100, making it a percent. This way, a person is  
able to see what percentage of their investment has been gained back after  
a period of time. Some, however, prefer to leave it in decimal form, or ratio  
form.  
Simple ROI Problems  
Here are a few examples to get the hang of calculating ROI.  
1. Gains = $535,000 and cost = 400,000. What is ROI?  
��� = 535,000 − 400,000  
400,000 = 135,000  
400,000 = 0.34 × 100 = 34%  
2. Gains = $3,640 and cost = $1,880. What is ROI?  
��� = 3,640 − 1,880  
1,880 = 1,760  
1,880 = 0.94 × 100 = 94%  
ROI 2  
Simple ROI Over Time  
3. You buy a car for $26,450. Because you now have reliable  
transportation, you are able to obtain a job and earn $10,860 in your  
first year. Calculate your return on investment for that year.  
��� = 10,860 − 26,450  
26,450 = −15,590  
26,450 = −0.59 × 100 = 59%  
4. A business purchases a new form of information system technology  
for $500,000. Because of this purchase, the company begins earning  
$50,000 a year. Find the ROI for the first year.  
��� = 50,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = −450,000  
500,000 = −0.9 × 100 = −90%  
What does a negative ROI mean? Let’s take a step back and think about a  
different question: what would it mean if we had a zero ROI? This only  
occurs when the numerator of our formula is zero, and this can only  
happen if our gains were the same as our costs, meaning we broke even.  
Therefore, if ROI is negative, the costs must be greater than the gains, or we  
have yet to achieve an amount of gain great enough to cover the cost of the  
investment. Once ROI is positive, that means we have earned more than the  
cost we put into the investment. When it’s positive, we have actually  
returned a profit!  
Investors calculate ROI over time to see how the value changes or when a  
positive ROI will occur. This gives them a better timeframe of how long it  
will take them to get an adequate return on their purchase.  
5. Take the business investment in Problem 4 and calculate their ROI  
for the first four years.  
���! = 50,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = −450,000  
500,000 = −0.9 × 100 = 90%  
���! = 100,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = −400,000  
500,000 = −0.8 × 100 = −80%  
���! = 150,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = −350,000  
500,000 = −0.7 × 100 = −70%  
���! = 200,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = −300,000  
500,000 = −0.6 × 100 = −60%  
ROI 3  
6. Take Problem 3. Calculate the ROI for each consecutive year until  
you obtain a positive return on their investment.  
���! = 10,860 − 26,450  
26,450 = −15,590  
26,450 = −0.59 × 100 = −59%  
���! = 21,720 − 26,450  
26,450 = −4,730  
26,450 = −0.18 × 100 = −18%  
���! = 32,580 − 26,450  
26,450 = 6,130  
26,450 = 0.23 × 100 = 23%  
Analyzing Different Scenarios  
To find the best investment, investors must analyze ROI calculations for  
different scenarios to see which produces the higher number, or higher  
return. This is so they know which purchase to make before they actually  
invest in a product. There are two different ways of predicting which  
investment in a series of scenarios will give the best return. The first  
method is to see which will give a positive return in the shortest amount of  
time.  
7. You crashed the car you bought in Problem 3, so you need to  
purchase a new one. You’ve narrowed your choice down to two cars.  
Car A is $19,345, and since gas would cost you about the same as for  
your old car, you would still be pocketing about $10,860 a year. Car B  
is $27,120 but is extremely good on gas mileage, so after paying for  
gas, you would be pocketing about $13,430 a year. Which car should  
you buy based on which one will give you a positive ROI faster?  
���!! = 10,860 − 19,346  
19,346 = −8,486  
19,346 = −0.44 × 100 = −44%  
���!! = 21,720 − 19,346  
19,346 = 2,374  
19,346 = 0.12 × 100 = 12%  
���!! = 13,430 − 27,120  
27,120 = −13,690  
27,120 = −0.50 × 100 = −50%  
���!! = 26,860 − 27,120  
27,120 = −260  
27,120 = −0.01 × 100 = −1%  
���!! = 40,290 − 27,120  
27,120 = 13,170  
27,120 = 0.49 × 100 = 49%  
Car A will give you a positive ROI faster and is thus is the best investment.  
ROI 4  
The second method of predicting which scenario will give you the best  
return is by seeing which investment will give you the highest ROI after a  
predetermined amount of time.  
8. Take the car decision you are trying to make in Problem 7. Which will  
be the best buy if you look at the ROI after three years?  
���!! = 10,860 − 19,346  
19,346 = −8,486  
19,346 = −0.44 × 100 = −44%  
���!! = 21,720 − 19,346  
19,346 = 2,374  
19,346 = 0.12 × 100 = 12%  
���!! = 32,580 − 19,346  
19,346 = 0.68 × 100 = 68%  
���!! = 13,430 − 27,120  
27,120 = −13,690  
27,120 = −0.50 × 100 = −50%  
���!! = 26,860 − 27,120  
27,120 = −260  
27,120 = −0.01 × 100 = −1%  
���!! = 40,290 − 27,120  
27,120 = 13,170  
27,120 = 0.49 × 100 = 49%  
Car A will give you the highest ROI after three years and thus is the best  
investment.  
What would it look like if we graphed ROI over time as points on a  
coordinate plane? In the space below, graph the two scenarios on a  
coordinate plane. Let the x-axis be time and the y-axis by ROI. Connect the  
points for each scenario to see what type of growth is produced. 80

ROI 5  
As the graphs of the points show, the growth of ROI in these scenarios is  
linear. What if we wanted to find the ROI after ten years? We can  
approximate the equation of the line so that we don’t have to keep  
calculating the different ROI calculations over time. With the equation, we  
can simply plug in the unit of time, and the output will produce the ROI at  
that point in time. So, first, approximate the equation of the line using the  
points you calculated from the best of the two scenarios. Then, find the ROI  
after ten years.  
����� = � = �! − �!  
�! − �!  
= 68 + 44  
3 − 1 = 112  
2 = 56  
� = �� + �  
⇒ 68 = 56 3 + �  
⇒ � = −100  
� = 56� − 100  
⇒ � = 56 10 − 100  
⇒ � = 460%  
Factors Affecting Cost and Gains from Investment  
It is easy to calculate ROI when the cost and gains are constant but this is  
rarely the actual case. Different factors may affect the cost and gains over  
time. For instance what if a loan had to be taken out to pay for the  
investment? The investor would have to pay interest on the amount owed.  
However as the money is paid back the amount of interest would decrease  
over time because it is calculated by how much money is owed. Another  
factor may include growth of revenue over time. If a business grows over  
time their revenue will increase causing their gains to increase over time.  
This may affect the way the growth of ROI looks over time.

9. Take the same car decision from Problems 7 and 8. Use the scenario  
from Car A except you receive a 20% raise each year from your job.  
Calculate the ROI over the first five years and then graph the results  
on a coordinate plane.  
���!! = 10,860 − 19,346  
19,346 = −8,486  
19,346 = −0.44 × 100 = −44%  
���!! = 10,860 + 10,860 + 10,860 . 2 − 19,346  
19,346  
= 10,860 + 13,032 − 19,346  
19,346 = 4,546  
19,346 = 0.23 × 100 = 23%  
���!! = 23,892 + 13,032 + 13,032 . 2 − 19,346  
19,346  
= 23,892 + 15,638.4 − 19,346  
19,346 = 20,184.4  
19,346 = 1.04 × 100 = 104%  
���!! = 39,530.4 + 15,638.4 + 15,638.4 . 2 − 19,346  
19,346  
= 39,530.4 + 18,766.08 − 19,346  
19,346 = 38,950.48  
19,346 = 2.01 × 100  
= 201%  
���!! = 58,296.48 + 18,766.08 + 18,766.08 . 2 − 19,346  
19,346  
= 58,296.48 + 22,520,02 − 19,346  
19,346 = 61,470.5  
19,346 = 3.18 × 100

ROI 7  
As you can see, the points look to produce exponential growth. Let’s try  
another example with other factors involved.  
10. Use the information from Problem 4. What if instead of just earning  
$50,000 a year, the company earned $50,000 more dollars each  
year than the year before? Calculate the ROI for the first five years  
of business. Then, graph the points.  
���! = 50,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = −450,000  
500,000 = −0.9 × 100 = −90%  
���! = 150,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = −350,000  
500,000 = −0.7 × 100 = −70%  
���! = 300,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = −200,000  
500,000 = −0.4 × 100 = −40%  
���! = 500,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = 0  
500,000 = 0 × 100 = 0%  
���! = 750,000 − 500,000  
500,000 = 250,000  
500,000 = 0.5 × 100 = 50%

ROI 8  
Once again, we can see that the graph of the points looks like an  
exponential function. Typically, this is the type of growth we see when  
dealing with ROI since it is usually used in business calculations. Over time,  
businesses grow as they become more productive, successful, and popular.  
Is it possible to approximate an equation for a function that goes through  
the points just like we did with the linear functions so we don’t have to  
make so many calculations to get the value we want?  
The answer is yes, but we must review what we know about exponential  
functions to be able to find this process. First of all, we know that these  
functions appear in the form of � = ��!, where � is a fixed constant that is  
where the function crosses the y-axis and � is the base. Having a positive  
exponent will produce exponential growth, and having a negative  
exponent will produce exponential decay (exponential decrease). We also  
know that the base for the exponential component has to be positive, but  
we are also dealing with negative values. However, we know that a vertical  
shift results if we add or subtract a value from our function. We can use  
this information to approximate a function for the previous problem.  
First of all, we need to find the constant so that we can form an equation.  
This can be done by finding where the function will cross the x-axis. This  
point occurs where � = 0 on the graph. Because � is a function of time in  
this example, and we know that when � = 0, no amount of time has passed,  
and therefore, no gains have been made yet. Accordingly, our ROI  
calculation is:  
��� = 0 − 19,346  
19,346 = −19,346  
19,346 = −1 ×100 = −100%  
So, the point in question is (0, −100). But wait, remember about the  
negative values? Let’s shift all of the points up 200 so that we don’t have to  
deal with those nasty negatives. Therefore, our graph looks like this:  
250  
200  
150  
100  
50  
1 2 3 4 5  
ROI 9  
Now, we just need to add 200 to all of our � values. This makes our initial  
point (0,100).  
We can then plug these initial values in to find the constant �.  
� = ��!  
⇒ 100 = ��!  
⇒ � = 100  
Now, we have the formula � = 100�!. We can take the last point, (5,50),  
which we changed to (5,250), and plug in for the corresponding values to  
find the other constant, �.  
� = 100�!  
⇒ 250 = 100�!  
⇒ 2.50 = �!  
⇒ � = 2.50 !  
⇒ � ≈ 1.20  
Now, we have the full equation � = 100(1.39)!. But wait! Don’t forget that  
we shifted the points up 200. We can shift them down by subtracting back  
the 200, so our actual equation is:  
� = 100(1.20)! − 200  
Let’s graph this function along with our points to see how close of an  
approximation it is.

x – 200  
ROI 10  
So, close, but not exact. It goes through the initial and last point because  
those are the points we used to find the values for our function. But why  
couldn’t we find a better model using our method?  
Why didn’t our approximation of the exponential function for our data  
points work? Let’s look at the � values of our points: -90, -70, -40, 0, and  
50. Is there a relationship between these points that might help us find a  
better approximation? Let’s find the differences between these values:  
−90 − (−100) = −90 + 100 = 10  
−70 − −90 = −70 + 90 = 20  
−40 − −70 = −40 + 70 = 30  
0 − −40 = 0 + 40 = 40  
50 − 0 = 50  
There is definitely a pattern between the differences of these values. The  
differences increase by 10 as the points progress. However, this does not  
seem to be growing exponentially but rather arithmetically. Therefore, this  
is not considered exponential growth. When growth LOOKS exponential  
but is NOT actually exponential, it usually means that a power function can  
be used to represent the points.  
Power Functions  
Power functions appear in the form:  
� � = ��!  
where � is a scaling factor and � is the power that controls the growth or  
decay (in this case, our growth).  
Notice that when we plug in 0 for �, we get:  
� � − � 0 ! = 0  
Therefore, power functions always pass through the point (0,0). This  
means that once again, we’ll need to move all of our points up so that the  
initial point passes through the origin. In light of this, let’s add 100 to all of  
our points so that we produce the graph:  
ROI 11  
Now, how do we find an equation for a power function using our points?  
Let’s plug in one of our points and see if we can find one of these values we  
need. Let’s use (1,10).  
� � = ��!  
⇒ 10 = �(1)!  
⇒ � = 10  
Let’s use another point, (5,150), to find �.  
� � = 10�!  
⇒ 150 = 10(5)!  
⇒ 15 = 5!  
⇒ ln 15 = ln (5!)  
⇒ ln 15 = � ln (5)  
⇒ � = ln (15)  
ln (5)  
⇒ � ≈ 1.68  
Therefore, our equation is:  
� � = 10�!.!&#8221;

Project  
Come up with your own situation involving ROI. It can be something that  
pertains to your life (buying a care, paying for college, buying a computer,  
etc.), a business example, or anything that involves putting money into  
some kind of investment and calculating its return. Think of all the  
possible factors that will affect calculations for ROI. These may include  
salary, bonuses, loans, interest rates, costs, insurance payments, etc.  
Produce at least three different scenarios and calculate the first five points  
for each. Your unit of time doesn’t necessarily have to be years. It may be  
more practical to use months, decades, etc. Find the best investment out of  
your scenarios and the parameters for it being the best. Next, find the type  
of function that is the best fit for your data points. Make sure you try AT  
LEAST linear, exponential, and power functions for your growth if not  
some other types of functions to find which one best fits your data. Then,  
produce a graph of a this function on a piece of poster board so that the  
class can see how your growth looks over time. Make sure the equation for  
the actual function is visible somewhere on your poster. Also, somewhere  
on your poster, present a problem about your scenario that the class will  
solve, whether it be just values that you plug into your function or a word  
problem involving your scenarios. We will present these projects to the  
class.
