  6.   Define Ellipse?
</div>

<div>
            An ellipse can use the same parameters xc, yc ,r as a circle, in addition to the
</div>

<div>
  eccentricity e. the eqn of an ellipse is:
</div>

<div>
                                                   2   2            2   2
</div>

<div>
                                           (x-xc) /a  + (y-yc) /b         = 1
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  7.   Define polygon?
</div>

<div>
            A polygon is any closed continues sequence of line segments ie, a polyline whose
</div>

<div>
  last node point is same as that of its first node point. The line segments form the sides of
</div>

<div>
  the polygon and their intersecting points form the vertices of the polygon.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  8.   Distinguish between convex and concave polygons?
</div>

<div>
            If  the  line  joining  any  two  points  in  the  polygon  lies  completely  inside  the
</div>

<div>
  polygon then, they are known as convex polygons. If the line joining any two points in
</div>

<div>
  the polygon lies outside the polygon then, they are known as concave polygons.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  9.   What is seed fill?
</div>

<div>
            One way to fill a polygon is to start from a given point (seed) known to be inside
</div>

<div>
  the polygon and highlight outward from this point i.e neighboring pixels until encounter
</div>

<div>
  the boundary pixels, this approach is called seed fill.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  10. What is scan line algorithm?
</div>

<div>
            One way to fill the polygon is to apply the inside test. i.e to check whether the
</div>

<div>
  pixel is inside the polygon or outside the polygon and then highlight the pixel which lie
</div>

<div>
  inside the polygon. This approach is known as scan-line algorithm.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  11. Define coherence properties?
</div>

<div>
            A coherence property of a scene is apart of a scene by which relate one part of the
</div>

<div>
  scene with the other parts of the scene.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  12. What is an active edge list in the scan line algorithm?
</div>

<div>
            The active edge list for a scan line contains all edges crossed by that scan line.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  13. What is a winding number?
</div>

<div>
            Winding number method is used to check whether a given point is inside or out
</div>

<div>
  side the polygon. In this method give a direction number to all the edges which cross the
</div>

<div>
  scan line. If the edge starts below the line and ends above scan line give direction as -1 .
</div>

<div>
  otherwise1. Fr polygons or two dimensional objects, the point is said to be inside when
</div>

<div>
  the value of winding number is nonzero.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  14. What is cell array?
</div>

<div>
            The cell array is a primitive that allows users to display an arbitrary shape defined
</div>

<div>
  as a two dimensional grid pattern.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  15. What is type face?
</div>

<div>
            Letters, numbers and other characters can be displayed in a variety of sizes and
</div>

<div>
  styles. The overall design style for a set of characters is called a type face.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  16. What do you mean by font?
</div>

<div>
            The term font referred to a set of cast metal character forms in a particular size
</div>

<div>
  and format, such as 10-point courier italic.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
                                                                                                                            5
