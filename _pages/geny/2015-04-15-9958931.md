<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Up until now, our digital circuits have been strictly combinational &#8212; they take inputs and react to them. While they are capable of complex calculations, they lack the ability to remember what they&#8217;ve done. This lack of memory severly restricts the capabilities of the circuits we can design.</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">The flip-flop is the basic unit of digital memory. A flip-flop can remember one bit of data. Sets of flip-flops are called registers, and can hold bytes of data. Sets of registers are called memories, and can hold many thousands of bits, or more.</span>

<span style="font-family:Verdana;">The basic flip-flop circuit is the classic set of cross-coupled NAND gates. Since nobody buils flip-flops from the gate level anymore, we&#8217;ll skip past this level of analysis, and move straight into the chips we&#8217;ll actually use. But if you&#8217;re interested, <em>The Art of Electronics</em> devotes many pages to the inner workings of flip-flops, from the cross coupled NAND&#8217;s on up.</span>
