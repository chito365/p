<strong>Mauricio Pellegrino has managed once in the Premier League, at Southampton.</strong>

The Argentinian had a distinguished career in his native country, before he won LaLiga with Barcelona and Valencia, where he also claimed a UEFA Cup in 2004.

In January 2005, the centre-back joined Liverpool under Rafael Benitez and then returned to Spain with Alaves, retiring in 2006.

Pellegrino coached Valencia's youth team and then returned to Benitez's Liverpool as first-team coach until 2010. The pair moved to Internazionale, where they departed in December 2010.

At the end of the 2011/12 season, Pellegrino was appointed manager of Valencia for a short spell.

He returned to Argentina in 2013 for a two-year stay with Estudiantes, before taking over at Independiente for a season.

Taking over former club Alaves ahead of the 2016/17 campaign, Pellegrino led the club to their first Copa del Rey final - losing 3-1 on aggregate to Barcelona.

On 23 June 2017, Southampton announced the Argentinian as Claude Puel's successor at St. Mary's Stadium.

However, the two departed company on 12 March 2018 with Southampton one place above the bottom three.</pre></section>

ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT OTHER ONES? I’VE GOT MY THOUGHTS, BUT I’M NOT REALLY SURE OF THEM, SO I THINK I’LL WAIT FOR OTHER THEORIES ABOUT FURTHER MANAGERS (AND PLAYERS).

YOU MAY LEAVE A COMMENT BELOW, SUGGESTING YOUR BEST MATCHING MBTI PERSONALITY.
