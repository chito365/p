As Eights become more insecure they become challenging, confrontational and threatening.Fives are a fear type so don’t like confrontation (although they often have a great deal of suppressed anger).They will stand up for themselves to a point but are highly sensitive to criticism and personal attacks so theirtendency is to retract from conflict.

Eights like partners who will engage their intensity and challenge them.

  * Help your Eight to think of consequences before impulsively
