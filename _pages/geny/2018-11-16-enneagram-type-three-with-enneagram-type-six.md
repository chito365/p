# <u>Potential Problems</u>

  * Three can experience Six as too: mistrustful, self-doubting, pessimistic and negative, cautious, questioning, blaming, over reactive and Three is an optimistic type with great ambition and determination to make things happen – fast. Six’s over-caution, procrastination and contrary thinking can feel like obstacles toThree’s driven, go-ahead energy, which is very frustrating. If Three discounts Six’s anxieties or shrugs offSix’s fearful concerns as silly or over-exaggerated then the relationship will go downhill fast.

# <u>Advice</u>

## For Threes

  * Your Six is not as inherently self-confident as you so don’t trivialize or dismiss your Six’s self-doubt and Really take time to listen to your Six’s feelings, fears and concerns. If you do this, and show loyalty and respect, your Six will be so committed to your success you won’t even believe it.

&nbsp;

## For Sixes

  * Realize that Three’s aren’t necessarily superficial and dishonest when they try to impress They justnaturally try to impress people just as you naturally try to protect yourself by being suspicious of people’smotives. Try not to be so disillusioned by your Three’s boasting or name dropping. It’s just the ego’s way ofseeking attention.
