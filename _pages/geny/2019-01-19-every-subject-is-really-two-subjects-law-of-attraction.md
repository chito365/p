The following are some examples to help you see how every subject is really two subjects:

&nbsp;

Abundance/Poverty (absence of abundance) Health/Illness (absence of health) Happiness/Sadness (absence of happiness) Clarity/Confusion (absence of clarity) Energetic/Tired (absence of Energy) Knowledge/Doubt (absence of knowledge) Interested/Bored (absence of interest)

&nbsp;

I can do that/I can’t do that

I want to buy that/I can’t afford that I want to feel good/I don’t feel good

I want more money/I don’t have enough money

I want more money/I don’t know how to get more money

I want more money/That person is getting more money than his/her share I want to be slender/I am fat I want a new car/My car is old I want a lover/I don’t have a lover

&nbsp;

As you read this list, it is undoubtedly obvious to you which we consider to be the better choice in each example, but there is a simple and important thing that you may be forgetting. There is a tendency as you read a list such as this to feel a need to state the factual truth about the subject (“tell it like it is”) rather than make the statement of what you desire. That tendency alone is responsible for more mistreating and more personal disallowing of wanted things than all other things put together, and so, the examples and exercises offered in this book are given to help you orient yourself toward what is _wanted,_ not to explain what already _is. You have to begin telling a different story if you want the <u>Law of Attraction </u>to bring you different things._

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250076"></a>What Is the Story I’m Now Telling?

** **

A very effective way to begin to tell that new story is to listen to the things that you are now saying throughout your day, and when you catch yourself in the middle of a statement that is contrary to what you want, stop and say, “Well, I clearly know what it is that I _don’t_ want. What is it that I _do_ want?” Then deliberately and emphatically make your statement of desire.

&nbsp;

_I hate this ugly, old, unreliable car._

I want a pretty, new, reliable car.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

_I’m fat._

I want to be slender.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

_My_ _employer_ _doesn’t_ _appreciate_ _me._

I want to be appreciated by my employer.

&nbsp;

Many would protest, claiming that a simple rewording of a sentence will not make a shiny new car appear in your driveway, or change your fat body to one that is slender, or cause your employer to

&nbsp;

Suddenly change her personality and begin to treat you differently—but they would be wrong. When you deliberately focus upon any desired subject, often proclaiming it to be as you _want_ it to be, in time you experience an actual shift in the way you feel about the subject, which indicates a vibrational shift.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

_When_ _your vibration shifts, your point of attraction shifts, and, by the powerful <u>Law of Attraction,</u> your manifestation evidence or indicator must shift, also. You cannot talk consistently of the things you do want to experience in your life without the Universe delivering the essence of them to you._

_ _

_ _**The _Pivoting Process_ Can Reorient My Life**

** **

The _Process_ _of Pivoting_ is a conscious recognition that every subject is really two subjects, and then a deliberate speaking or thinking about the _desired_ aspect of the subject. _Pivoting_ will help you activate within yourself the aspects that you desire regarding all subjects; and once you accomplish that, the essence of the things that you desire, on all subjects, must come into your experience.

&nbsp;

There is an important clarification that we must make here: If you are using words that speak of something that you desire while at the same time you are feeling _doubt_ about your own words, your _words_ are not bringing you what you want, because the way you are _feeling_ is the true indication of the creative direction of your thought-vibration. _The <u>Law of Attraction </u>is not responding to your words but to the vibration that is emanating from you._

_ _

However, since you cannot speak of what you _do_ want and what you _do not_ want at the same time, the more you speak of what you _do_ want, the less frequently you will be speaking of what you _do not_ want. And if you are serious about telling it like you want it to be rather than like it is, you will, in time (and usually a rather short time), change the balance of your vibration. If you speak it often enough, you will come to feel what you speak.

&nbsp;

But there is something even more significantly powerful about this _Process of Pivoting: When life seems to have you negatively oriented toward the lack of something you want, and when you make the statement “I know what I do <u>not </u>want; what is it that I <u>do </u>want?” the answer to that question is summoned from within you, and in that very moment the beginning of a vibrational shift occurs.  <u>Pivoting</u> is a powerful tool that will instantly improve your life._

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250075"></a>     I Am the Creator of My Life Experience

** **

You are the creator of your own life experience, and as the creator of your experience, it is important to understand that it is not by virtue of your action, not by virtue of your doing—it is not even by virtue of what you are saying—that you are creating. You are creating by virtue of the thought that you are offering.

&nbsp;

_You_ _cannot speak or offer action without thought-vibration occurring at the same time; however, you are often offering a thought-vibration without offering words or action. Children or babies learn to mimic the vibration of the adults who surround them long before they learn to mimic their words._

_ _

Every thought that you think has its own vibrational frequency. Each thought that you offer, whether it has come to you out of your memory, whether it is an influence from another, or whether it is a thought that has become the combination of something _you_ have been thinking and something that _another_ has been thinking— every thought that you are pondering in your _now_—is vibrating at a very personal frequency . . . and by the powerful _Law of Attraction_ (the essence of that which is like unto itself, is drawn), that thought is now attracting another thought that is its Vibrational Match. And now, those combined thoughts are vibrating at a frequency that is higher than the thought that came before; and they will now, by the _Law of Attraction,_ attract another and another and another, until eventually the thoughts will be powerful enough to attract a “real life” situation or manifestation.

&nbsp;

_All people, circumstances, events, and situations are attracted to you by the power of the thoughts that you are thinking. Once you understand that you are literally thinking or vibrating things into being, you may discover a new resolve within you to more deliberately direct your own thoughts._

### <a name="_TOC_250074"></a>  Aligned Thoughts Are Thoughts That Feel Good

** **

Many people believe that there is more to their Bitingness than what is represented in their physical reality as the flesh, blood, and bone person they know themselves to be. As people grapple with ways to label this larger part of them, they use words such as _Soul, Source,_ or _God._ We refer to that larger, older, wiser part of you as your _Inner Being,_ but the label that you choose to describe this Eternal part of you is not important. What is extremely significant is that you understand that the larger _you_ does, and will eternally, exist and plays a very large part in the experience that you are living here on planet Earth.

&nbsp;

Every thought, word, or deed that you offer is played against the backdrop of that Broader Perspective. Indeed, the reason that in any moment of clearly knowing what you _do not_ want, you emphatically then realize what it is that you _do_ want is because that larger part of you is giving its undivided attention to what you _do_ want.

&nbsp;

As you make a conscious effort to guide your thoughts, day by day, more in the direction of what you _do_ want, you will begin to feel better and better because the vibration that is activated by your improved-feeling thought will be a closer match to the vibration of the larger Non-Physical part of you. Your desire to think thoughts that feel good will guide you into alignment with the Broader Perspective of your _Inner Being._ In fact, it is not possible for you to really feel good in any moment unless the thoughts you are thinking right now are a Vibrational Match to the thoughts of your _Inner Being._

_ _

For example, your _Inner Being_ focuses upon your value—when you identify some flaw in yourself, the negative emotion that you feel is about that vibrational discord or resistance. Your _Inner Being_ chooses to focus only upon things about which it can feel love—when you are focusing upon some aspect of someone or something that you abhor, you have focused yourself out of vibrational alignment with your _Inner Being._ Your _Inner Being_ focuses only upon your success—when you choose to see something you are doing as failure, you are out of alignment with the perspective of your _Inner Being._

### <a name="_TOC_250073"></a>   Seeing My World through the Eyes of Source

** **

By choosing better-feeling thoughts and by speaking more of what you _do_ want and less of what you _do not_ want, you will gently tune yourself to the vibrational frequency of your broader, wiser _Inner Being._ To be in vibrational alignment with that Broader Perspective while living your own physical life experience is truly the best of all worlds because as you achieve vibrational alignment with that Broader Perspective, you then see your world from that Broader Perspective. _To see your world through the eyes of Source is truly the most spectacular view of life, for from that vibrational vantage point, you are in alignment with—and therefore in the process of attracting— only what you would consider to be the very best of your world._

&nbsp;

Esther, the woman who translates the vibration of Abraham into the spoken or written word, does so by relaxing and deliberately allowing the vibration of her own being to rise until it harmonizes with the Non-Physical vibration of Abraham. She has been doing this for many years now, and it has become a very natural thing for her to do. She has long understood the advantage of aligning her vibration so that she could effectively translate our knowledge for other physical friends, but she had not really understood another wonderful benefit of that alignment until one beautiful spring morning when she walked down the driveway by herself to open the gate for her mate, who would eventually follow in the automobile.

&nbsp;

As she stood there waiting, she gazed up into the sky and found it to be more beautiful than it had ever appeared before: It was rich in color and the contrast of the brilliant blue sky and the strikingly white clouds was amazing to her. She could hear the sweet songs of birds that were so far away she could not see them, but their beautiful sound made her shiver with excitement as she heard them. They sounded as if they were right above her head or sitting on her shoulder. And then she became aware of many different delicious fragrances flowing from plants and flowers and earth, moving in the wind and enveloping her. She felt alive and happy and in love with her beautiful world. And she said right out loud, “There can never have been, in the entire Universe, a more beautiful moment in time than this, right here, right now!”

And then she said, “Abraham, it is _you,_ isn’t it?” And we smiled a very broad smile through her lips, for she had caught us peeping through her eyes, hearing through her ears, smelling through her nose, and feeling through her skin.

“Indeed,” we said, “we are enjoying the deliciousness of your physical world through your physical body.”

&nbsp;

Those moments in your life when you feel absolute exhilaration are moments of complete alignment with the Source within you. Those moments when you feel powerful attraction to an idea, or keen interest, are also moments of complete alignment. In fact, the better you feel the more in alignment you are with your Source — with _who-you-really-are._

_ _

This alignment with your Broader Perspective will not only allow you faster achievement of the big things that you want in life—like wonderful relationships, satisfying careers, and the resources to do the things you really want to do—but this conscious alignment will enhance every moment of your day. _As you tune yourself to the perspective of your <u>Inner Being, </u>your days will be fled with wonderful moments of clarity, satisfaction, and love. And that is truly the way you intended to live while here in this wonderful place, this wonderful time, and this wonderful body._
