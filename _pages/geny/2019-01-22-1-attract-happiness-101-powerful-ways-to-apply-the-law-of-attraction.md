  1. **Attract Happiness** &#8211; You can have all of the things you ever wanted in the world and without happiness, they will mean nothing to This is why attracting happiness should come first on your list of powerful ways to use the Law of Attraction.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**What to do:** Act as if you are happy by putting a smile on your face. This tells the universe that you are accepting happiness and focusing on it. In return, you will be rewarded with happiness around every corner! If you begin to feel especially down for any reason, use positive thinking and affirmations to build your happy level back up. A good laugh also sends out strong signals that you want to attract more happiness. This is why you should definitely spend a few minutes a day doing something that makes you giggle or even roar with laughter such as watching funny YouTube videos or a comedy film. Goofing around with friends will magnify happiness for everyone involved as well.

&nbsp;

# Happiness Affirmations:

** **

  * I am happier with every day that goes by
  * I gain happiness in everything that I do
  * My friends, family, and daily activities bring me great happiness
  * I am so grateful to live in a world full of contagious happiness
  * This life I have brings me so much happiness that I can&#8217;t help but smile

&nbsp;

# Happiness Visualization Technique:

&nbsp;

When you wake up in the morning or whenever you begin to feel your happiness dwindle, get into a place where you can be alone for a few minutes. You don&#8217;t have to be sitting or laying down to visualize, but it does help. First, close your eyes and breath deeply.

&nbsp;

Slowly begin to focus your mind on a moment where you were completely happy, or on a place that makes you feel very happy. Whatever that is for you, imagine it in your mind&#8217;s eye. Think about how happy it makes you to be there in that moment and let everything else disappear. Allow yourself to feel the smile on your face. Let your senses come alive and use them in your imaginary world to taste, touch, smell, see, and hear your surroundings.

&nbsp;

When you feel your happiness begin to recharge, imagine yourself in your life now, feeling just as happy as you do in your happy place. In circumstances that normally make you feel unhappy, picture yourself going through them happily as ever. Think about how much happiness you have and how their is an abundance of happiness for you at all times.

&nbsp;

Open your eyes feeling refreshed, wonderful and above all, very happy! Repeat as needed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

    <strong>Gain Wealth </strong>&#8211; Wealth is having the ability and means to get the things in life that you want and that help you achieve your Having money is the way our society gifts us with wealth and the universe has an abundance of wealth to give. So why doesn&#8217;t everyone have wealth, you might ask? That&#8217;s because they have their wealth attracting magnets set to repel, which is never a good thing! There are some changes you&#8217;ll need to make before your wealth magnet can reach its full potential.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do:** Firstly, you must eliminate all beliefs about money that portray it in a negative light. You might not even realize it, but our childhoods are littered with negative comments by parents and other adults about wealth and money. The biggest of these includes &#8220;money is evil&#8221; or &#8220;wealthy people are selfish&#8221; but these negative beliefs are simply not true. Instead, think about all of the good you will be able to do when you have obtained wealth. There is nothing evil or selfish about charity work or providing for those you love! Embrace this new relationship with money and welcome more of it into your life with open arms. The universe will reward you.

&nbsp;

# Wealth Affirmations:

** **

  * I have been and will always be wealthy
  * I am continuously increasing my wealth with every passing day
  * It makes me feel excited to know that an abundance of wealth is available to me
  * Being wealthy fills me with total contentment and pure joy
  * Anything that I do always produces a prosperous growth in my wealth

&nbsp;

# Wealth Visualization Technique:

** **

Creating a vision board is an excellent visualization technique, especially for amassing wealth. You&#8217;ll need a poster board, tape or glue, magazines or computer and printer, and a marker.

&nbsp;

Think about what it means to you to be wealthy. What would you buy? How much money would you have? Who would be in your life? When you come up with your own personal definition of wealth, look for images in magazines or on the computer that correspond with that idea.

&nbsp;

Cut out or print off the images you find that make you think of the wealthy life you want. Glue or tape them to your poster board, with the biggest things in the center and the smaller things around those. Be sure to leave enough room next to each image for an affirmation.

&nbsp;

Now create your affirmations by using the present tense form of the statement. For instance, if your idea of wealth is traveling the world, include an image of yourself on a private jet with the affirmations, &#8220;My growing wealth allows me to travel the world.&#8221;

&nbsp;

Keep your vision board in a place you look several times throughout the day and allow the feelings of actually having those things to stay in your mind. The more you feel those emotions of abundance, the sooner the Law of Attraction will work to bring wealth and prosperity to your life.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <strong>Find Love </strong>&#8211; Love is considered to be the most powerful emotion and for good It is something so precious that we can often send out signals to the universe that actually prevent us from ever finding it. Why? Because many people harbor fear, doubt or insecurities about love that keep them stuck in a love rut. Getting out of this rut isn&#8217;t really hard as long as you develop the proper attitude and do away with some of the feelings that have you stuck in the first place.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do: ** Spend some time each day allowing positive feelings about love to become dominant in your mind. Visualize your perfect partner and how amazing they make you feel. Think about the things you will do together and believe that you will have him or her very soon. Find every opportunity to exercise feelings of love. For example, you could adopt a pet, spend time with family or even enjoy a hobby. Focus on those feelings of love deeply and imagine how wonderful it will feel when you can use them on your very own partner. Another great method is to create daily affirmations about finding your true love. Something as simple as, &#8220;I fall in love with the perfect person for me and the love is mutual.&#8221;

&nbsp;

# Love Affirmations:

** **

  * I am worthy of being loving and being loved in return
  * The one that I love is being drawn closer and closer to me right now
  * Love is passionate, kind, and completely available to me
  * Loving feels amazing and so does being loved
  * Being in love is a powerful feeling that I am fully open to experiencing

&nbsp;

# Love Visualization Technique:

** **

Go through a day in your mind where you have your perfect partner and you are both deeply in love with each other. Think about what you will do together, the words that you say to each other, and how warm and sensational they feel in your arms.

&nbsp;

Allow yourself to picture your lover in vivid detail. Now imagine running into them during your day and how you both feel an immediate and strong connection. Think about what you will talk about when you first meet, what you will have in common, and what kind of things you will do. Allow the feelings of having someone to love bring you great pleasure.

&nbsp;

Now release this desire to the universe with complete faith that you will soon find that person and build a loving relationship that can withstand anything.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <strong>Make True Friends </strong>&#8211; We are social creatures that need friendships to truly Even if you don&#8217;t have any friends now, with the Law of Attraction, you can develop lasting and true friendships. Many people tend to think negatively about having friends if they don&#8217;t have any or if they have been betrayed in the past, but the truth is that true friends are worth having. They are your shoulder to lean on in times of trouble and a great source of joy in times of peace.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do:** You must eliminate any insecurities that tell you that you&#8217;re not deserving of friends. This can be done through visualization exercises and positive affirmations. Picture yourself feeling confident and secure of yourself. Then visualize making friends and enjoying activities together. Repeat affirmations daily that target your specific reasons for thinking negatively about friendships. For instance, if you feel that you are not worthy of friends because you are too shy, use the affirmation, &#8220;I am worthy of friends because I am kind.&#8221; Adjust the affirmation to help you overcome any negativity surrounding friendship and the universe will respond.

&nbsp;

# Affirmations for Friendships:

** **

  * I am completely deserving of having true and loyal friends
  * Friends are a big part of my life and they make me feel complete
  * I easily attract the kind of friends that make my life better
  * Every day I attract more positive and friendly people into my life
  * People are attracted to me because I am a naturally friendly person

&nbsp;

# Friendship Visualization Technique:

Imagine yourself in the place where you would like to meet with friends to enjoy each other&#8217;s company. Think about laughing, goofing around, doing activities you enjoy, and just having a great time together.

&nbsp;

Visualize yourself having a lot of fun with your friends. Picture how you meet your friends and what you have in common. While you are visualizing your friendships, keep in mind that you are deserving of friends and how easy it is for you to make friends.

&nbsp;

If you feel insecure about a particular part of making friends, practice doing them flawlessly and with great reward in your visualizations. For example, if you are shy and don&#8217;t feel comfortable looking at someone in the eyes, practice doing this in your visualized situation.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    <strong>Follow Your Passion </strong>&#8211; Following your passion is all about doing what makes you feel alive and in tune with the universal life There are things that evoke strong positive emotions and these things are your passions. No matter what your passion is, the Law of Attraction can help you follow it. Whether you love gaming, painting, writing, technology, science, or anything else, following your passion is the gateway to success.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do:** Don&#8217;t judge yourself for loving what you are passionate about. If something compels you to act, allow yourself to do it. Of course there are obvious exceptions to following your passions. You don&#8217;t want to be passionate about anything destructive.  When judging whether a passion is a passion rather than an obsession or addiction, ask yourself if it is making a positive difference or a negative one. That will help you become clear about what your passions truly are so that you can devote your focus to them. Never allow obsessions and addictions to remain in your life. Fuel your passions by learning everything you can about them and taking action to make them possible.

&nbsp;

# Affirmations for Following Your Passion:

** **

  * I am free to pursue the things I am passionate about
  * My passions bring me great happiness and abundance
  * When I follow my passion it always leads me in the right direction
  * My passions can be used in a positive way
  * I am capable of turning my passion into a productive opportunities

&nbsp;

# Visualization Technique for Following Your Passion:

** **

Be honest with yourself about what you are passionate about rather than others to persuade you otherwise. If you enjoy something and it brings you great happiness, this is what you should focus on pursuing. You can always be outstanding at something when you have passion behind it. Keep this in mind when you close your eyes to begin visualizing.

&nbsp;

Think about yourself as an older version of you that has accomplished turning their passion into something that generates wealth, happiness and all of the things that you want. Envision yourself going through a day as this version of yourself and pay close attention to how you act, what you feel, who is with you and what you are doing.

&nbsp;

Now think back as if looking through memories and ask yourself how you got there? Let your mind lead you towards the path and welcome the answers to your success in following your passion. Repeat this exercise daily until you are sure of your plans to pursue your passion.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<ol start="6">
  <li>
    <strong>Give to Others </strong>&#8211; The Law of Attraction makes it possible to have an Because of this surplus of wealth and success you attract, you can give to others. Giving to others will give you a great sense of accomplishment and happiness. As an added bonus, whatever you give comes back to you multiplied greatly.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do:** There are many different ways to do this such as giving to charity organizations, hosting your own charity for a cause you are passionate about, or even buying nice things for the ones you love. Spontaneous giving can be among the most rewarding. The next time you see someone struggling to pay in line, offer to chip in the rest of their bill. If you don&#8217;t have a lot of money of your own yet, simply give of your time by volunteering at a local shelter, hospital or retirement center. You would be surprised how much generosity can fill you with great pleasure.

&nbsp;

# Affirmations for Generosity:

  * When I give to others I gain more than I give
  * Giving to others makes me feel totally at peace with myself

Think about who it is you want to help. Now don&#8217;t think of their current situation or any suffering, but of how you want them to feel after you have given them whatever it is they need. Imagine them smiling and feeling good as you have provided for them exactly what they needed. Imagine how grateful they are to you and how wonderful it feels to give them what they needed.

&nbsp;

Now think about how the circumstances all aligned to be able to give you the surplus that allowed you to give so generously. Thank the universe for its abundance and know that you will always have plenty for yourself and those you want to provide for.

A single helping hand to someone in need will be remembered for many years to come. Those you show kindness too now will never forget what you did and become inspired to spread their own kindness in the future. The remarkable acts of kindness such as opening a door, carrying someone&#8217;s groceries, fixing a leaky faucet for a neighbor, or helping someone track down their lost pet are all part of an infinite universal web. This web becomes more beautiful with every act of kindness you spread. The more beautiful it becomes, the more you will be treated with kindness in return.

&nbsp;

# Kindness Visualizations:

** **

If you are struggling with kindness, you should do this visualization at least once daily until you find it easy to be kind on a regular basis. Begin by picturing yourself in a situation where you would typically have a difficult time being kind. This might be in traffic, at work, with your family, or a particularly annoying situation.

Rather than visualizing how you would normally react in that situation, imagine yourself practicing complete control over your mind and actions and that you actually want to be kind. Focus on how easy it is to be kind instead of getting upset or being mean. Pay attention to how good it makes you feel inside to overcome even the most challenging situations you face.

&nbsp;

Practice in different situations based on the current issues in your life. This visualization can be used to be kinder to those you love and even complete strangers. Use various scenarios to practice your kindness and you will see those visualizations rubbing off on your real life.

    <strong>Fix Your Flaws </strong>&#8211; We all have flaws that we want to work And what better way to do it than with the Law of Attraction? If you are constantly doing something wrong or don&#8217;t like something about your character, you can change. It&#8217;s never too late to work on flaws so that you can become the person you have always wanted to be.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do:** All it takes to fix your flaws is a little positive thinking, the right attitude and meditation. First, know that you have what it takes to make the changes in your life. Believe in yourself with all of your heart. Next, shift your focus from the flaw, to the opposite good characteristic you want to obtain. For instance, if your flaw is that you say hurtful things, shift your focus to saying helpful things that make everyone feel good. Meditate while visualizing yourself speaking kindly and helpfully in your daily life. The meditation should be done once or twice daily so that it becomes natural to talk without saying hurtful things. Modify the technique to fix your own personal flaws.

&nbsp;

# Affirmations to Fix Flaws:

** **

  * I am exactly who I want to be
  * My thoughts, actions and words are carefully considered
  * I am a good person that strives to do my best in all areas
  * I take pride in the person I am and look forward to continued improvement
  * I know that I can do whatever it is that I set my mind to

&nbsp;

# Visualization Technique to Fix Flaws:

** **

This visualization works best if used in the morning when you first wake up and immediately before going to sleep at night. Lay down in bed and get comfortable to begin. Then close your eyes and breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth.

&nbsp;

Focus on one particular aspect of yourself that you would like to improve. This could literally be anything you want. Now think about a situation when you usually have this problem, but instead visualize yourself without it. Watch how things fall into place as you fix the flaw and really let yourself feel how good it is to overcome it. Know that you are strong enough to overcome any flaw.

&nbsp;

Immediately after the visualization, repeat one or more of the above affirmations ten times. This will help your subconscious absorb what you visualized more efficiently.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<ol start="9">
  <li>
    <strong>Learn Patience </strong>&#8211; They say patience is a virtue and for good If you can wait for something without getting frustrated during the process, you will find that good things surprise you. Everything that you receive will become much more valuable and your days will be much less stressful. Patience is easy to learn if you know what to do.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do:** Patience comes with a change in how you see the waiting period. Rather than focusing only on the light at the end of the tunnel, enjoy the walk through the tunnel itself! When you shift your attention to enjoying the path you are on, it becomes easy to have patience. And when you do reach your goal, it will feel as if the wait wasn&#8217;t long at all. Chances are that what you experience right now on your journey can be just as rewarding as the goal you are waiting for.

&nbsp;

# Affirmations for Patience:

** **

  * I am able to be patient in any situation
  * It is my pleasure to be understanding and tolerant
  * I have complete patience with myself as well as others
  * I am able to wait patiently when things take more time than I expect
  * I am as patient as a caterpillar in a cocoon transforming into a butterfly

&nbsp;

# Visualization Technique for Patience:

** **

This is a technique that can be use practically anywhere patience begins to evade you. It is quick and works very well. The first visualization takes longer, while subsequent visualizations require only a few seconds.

&nbsp;

For the first visualization, picture yourself in the situations that you lose patience in. For many this is a long line, when someone is being nasty, or when waiting to get off work. Whatever it is, picture that you are there right now. Then imagine yourself becoming preoccupied with understanding the situation rather than wanting it to be over or allowing yourself to lash out. Think about ways to turn it into a positive or funny situation, like visualizing your boss with a clown nose, or how strong your legs are becoming when you stand for a long time. Find a positive way to let off some of your built up steam. For example, if you are imagining yourself at work, dive into it with a positive attitude, organize your workspace, or come up with ways to make yourself more efficient.

&nbsp;

Once you come up with a loophole during your visualization, think of a word that helps you remember to use it during you real life experiences. Put this word in a visible place or even write it on your hand. Whenever you are feeling inpatient at all, look at the word and let it remind you of your visualization. Quickly picture your visualization and gain strength from it.

Is there a gate surrounding it or a big open and inviting yard? Think about how amazing your dream home looks and what it makes you feel like.

&nbsp;

Visualize yourself walking into your dream home as if you already live there. What furniture do you have, what does the decor look like? Do you have marble floors, hardwood floors, or carpeting? How many rooms does it have and what do they look like? What kind of appliances are in your kitchen? Do you have a garage? Explore your home inside and out.

Remember to enjoy the process of building your business rather than being too caught up in the end result. When you live in the moment, things happen without you even having to try very hard. Never stop learning new things that are relevant to your business and always do your best to listen to your intuition. Sometimes it can be the universe&#8217;s way of helping you succeed.

</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do:** Just like the determined and fierce athletes with disabilities, you too can overcome any physical challenge to accomplish whatever you set your mind to. The Law of Attraction will guarantee it. All you must do is have faith in yourself and believe that you do have what it takes. Then don&#8217;t stop until you achieve your goals.

Athletes have been using this technique for centuries in order to achieve what some would call impossible. These visualizations have been known to help anyone go above and beyond the limitations of physical strength to beat all odds. This technique requires lots of time and concentration so be sure to clear up about 30 minutes of time (it can be broken down into shorter periods) to master it.

&nbsp;

The best time to do this visualization is as you are falling asleep. Incredibly, some can even carry it into their dreams to that they are literally practicing in a virtual world in their sleep. The more you visualize yourself as the powerful and successful person you are, the more you will believe it and the better you will perform.

&nbsp;

Visualize yourself doing what it is that you want to be able to do. This could be anything, from walking pain-free, to making your way past an entire football field of players to make a mind blowing touchdown.

    <strong>Remove Limiting Beliefs </strong>&#8211; Limiting beliefs can completely control you and keep you from the path of your Negative beliefs about various things in life will prevent you from ever truly reaching your full potential. A belief is a feeling that something is true, which means that it has the potential to be dead wrong. And limiting beliefs are almost always as false as the path they lead you in. Getting rid of your limiting beliefs is really simple.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do:** The first thing to do is to identify your limiting beliefs. Often times we will be prevented from moving forward, but we are not sure exactly why. Take a while to really determine what you want and ask yourself what it is that is holding you back. For instance, you could want to buy your first home, but you believe that it will be a burden that you cannot handle. You must prove this belief wrong by finding the reasons you believe this and proving those reasons to be untrue. More often than not, it is your own fear of accepting new challenges that holds you back rather than an inability to do so. Some people severely limit their ability to make positive changes in their lives just because they don&#8217;t realize this. Now you know!

&nbsp;

# Affirmations to Remove Limiting Beliefs:

** **

  * I let go of all the beliefs and opinions that prevent me from moving forward
  * Believing in things that free me to achieve success makes me feel invincible
  * As I let go of my limiting beliefs, my goals become clearly obtainable for me
  * I refuse to believe anything that makes me feel powerless or doubtful
  * I embrace new beliefs that make me feel powerful and confident in myself and the universe

&nbsp;

# Visualization Technique to Remove Limiting Beliefs:

** **

Start off my making a list of your limiting beliefs, but instead of writing down the actual limiting belief, turn it into what you want to believe instead. So, if you feel that money will cause you to become greedy and evil, write down that money will allow you to show your generosity and kindness.

&nbsp;

Using this example, think about yourself earning lots of money so that you have more than you could ever need or spend. Think about how good it makes you feel to have that kind of money and to be able to provide for yourself completely and shower the ones you care about with nice things. Then think about how generous you are with the money and be giving with it.

&nbsp;

Donate to charities, help a person in need, create your own charitable organization or sponsor some children in areas suffering economically in your visualizations. Also picture yourself being nice to everyone, even those that have very little wealth or status. Imagine giving a shivering homeless person a nice warm coat or offering a person who deserves a second chance a job.

&nbsp;

When you think about these things in your mind, your subconscious will begin to form new beliefs that wealth will allow you to be even more generous and provide more opportunities for you to be kind to others.

&nbsp;

Change the content of your visualizations to match the opposite of your limiting beliefs using your own list of new freeing beliefs.

Instead of thinking about the ugly rainy weather, think about how beautiful the plants and trees will look with the abundance of water. When you find yourself thinking about a slow internet connection or poor phone service, think about what it would be like not to have internet or phones at all. These ways of thinking will open your heart to a feeling of gratitude that will go a long way towards improving your life.

&nbsp;

**What to do:** The number one way to maintain good health is to think healthy thoughts and refrain from thinking about being sick or unhealthy in any way. Rather than thinking about the fact that you really don&#8217;t want to catch a cold, think about how much you enjoy breathing freely and feeling amazing. When you catch yourself feeling nervous about health issues, switch you state of thinking to a more positive one. Focus on healthy habits that will give you a healthy mind and body in return. All of the focus on a healthy lifestyle will be rewarded with good health. One of the most obvious ways the Law of Attraction has affected health is by taking a look at the placebo effect. When one believes that they are taking a remedy for an ailment, they begin to feel better and in some cases cure themselves!

Keep these thoughts in your head when you begin to visualize.

Now think about each individual system being healthy and working perfectly. Watch your white blood cells fight off any invaders and eliminate anything that could cause it harm with ease. Picture your heart pumping strong and steady, you lungs absorbing all the oxygen it needs and all of your organs doing their job without a single problem. Think of your mind and body as a beautiful light that removes all darkness and heals instantly.

    <strong>Change Your Attitude </strong>&#8211; Attitude is A person with a negative attitude will not get far at all, but a person with a positive attitude can take themselves all the way to the top. Those who think negatively think in terms of glass half empty, thinking of mistakes and lack of success as permanent failure. Whereas positive thinkers see the glass as half full, realizing the true potential of mistakes and obstacles as learning opportunities towards success.

&nbsp;

**What to do:** The first step to changing your attitude towards anything is to take responsibility for your negative thinking and responses in the past and see them for the destructive things they are.

Find excitement and a feeling of empowerment as you accomplish work and if you must, break large projects down into mini-tasks and celebrate after each completed milestone.

    <strong>Eliminate Insomnia </strong>&#8211; If you have trouble sleeping, your whole life can be You feel groggy, moody and irritable during the day, and miserable at night. But thanks to the Law of Attraction, most cases of insomnia can be eliminated or greatly relieved.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**What to do:** The main mistake people make with insomnia is that they focus all of their thoughts on trying to calm their mind to fall asleep while the mind continues to race. This tells the universe that you have a mind that is not calm and that you cannot sleep so you end up hurting your sleep efforts even more. Rather than focusing on that, focus on a different technique. When it is time for bed, take about 30 minutes to allow any and all thoughts to come to your mind and appreciate them. If you begin to focus on solving a problem, write it down and think of any solution that comes to mind, even if it is to simply think about it tomorrow. Then put your writing away and tell yourself that you are done with them now. Then lay down, close your eyes and picture that you are looking at yourself in a place of your choice that makes you feel calm and relaxed. Watch yourself falling asleep in your mind in that oasis. A good place to imagine is a beach because you can watch the waves roll in or imagine dolphins playing in the distance. Chances are you will be asleep and dreaming of your oasis all night long.

&nbsp;

# Affirmations to Eliminate Insomnia:

&nbsp;

# Visualization Technique to Eliminate Insomnia:

** **

One of the most wonderful visualization methods for insomnia treatment is based on reverse psychology first, and then Law of Attraction second. It works incredibly well for people with chronic insomnia or for those that simply don&#8217;t feel very tired when it is time to go to sleep. First, determine a place using your imagination where you would feel completely at peace and relaxed. This could be a magical place such as a bed of clouds with healing powers, or somewhere very safe such as a fortress with a cozy bed inside. Get creative, but make sure you would really feel completely at ease there.

&nbsp;

Now, create a treacherous journey in your mind. This part is meant to tire your mind and body by creating a very physically challenging adventure that is the only thing between you and your relaxing place of slumber. This could be a climb up a steep mountainside, a paddle down a rushing river, a desperate crawl through the Sahara desert,  a trek across frozen tundra, or a swim across the icy waters of the arctic ocean. Really imagine what it would feel like, how hard it would be, and continue to push yourself for as long as you can. The idea is to feel such anticipation for your relaxing, safe place that you just cannot wait to get to it!

&nbsp;

After a good long time, imagine that you see your oasis off in the distance. You can finally see it and you work hard to get to your destination. When you finally get there, you are so mentally tired and so physically exhausted that you fall asleep as soon as you get into the horizontal position.

A saying that has helped keep many people on track towards their fitness goals is, &#8220;No food tastes as good as being in shape feels.&#8221; Whenever you are tempted to eat something naughty, think about how much better it feels to look good in your own skin.

After all, you attract what you think about.

**What to do:** The first step to stop worry from being the center of your every thought is to switch over to being an optimist. Optimists don&#8217;t worry. They live life knowing that with their efforts and positive thinking anything is possible. Try the N.I.C.E. technique.(Notice, Intervene, Change, Embrace). Wear a rubber band, bracelet, or anything else as a reminder to be NICE. If you catch yourself worrying about anything at all, notice it. Then intervene with your line of thinking and change it. Finally, embrace your new thought by feeling good about it. For example, you are working on a project and begin to worry about the deadline and being incapable of meeting it. You see your reminder and notice these worries which makes you remember to intervene and change your thinking. Instead you think, &#8220;I have what it takes to get the work done in plenty of time.&#8221; Then think about how good it will feel when you finish with spare time and let that make you feel good inside.

Identify your worries and write them down on paper. Now close your eyes and think about the things you have written. Focus on one worry at a time. Picture the situation that you are worried about as if it was happening in this very moment.

&nbsp;

Instead of allowing yourself to visualize the situation going badly, imagine that it is already going perfectly and without a single problem. Focus on how happy and relieved you are that the situation is going so well. Thank the universe for giving you positive results.

&nbsp;

If something is already going wrong and it makes you feel worried, visualize that it works out in some way for the better. That there is some reason for the situation and that you will come out of it a better person. Think of it as the dark night before a beautiful morning. Above all, keep an optimistic attitude during your visualizations.

Rather than saying you want something to stop, say you want something to start.

# Affirmations to Improve Your Marriage:

** **

  * I am married to the most amazing person in the entire world
  * My marriage is one of the best things that has ever happened to me
  * I love doing things that make my husband/wife happy

&nbsp;

# Visualization Technique to Improve Your Marriage:

** **

Visualize the way you want your marriage to be and use affirmations together to instill characteristics you want to have. For instance, if your spouse wants you to put your socks in the hamper rather than the floor, be receptive and use affirmations to help you do this coupled with visualizing yourself taking your socks off and putting them in the hamper immediately. And if you want your spouse to help more around the house with chores, have them repeat an affirmation followed by visualizing completing the chores and enjoying it.

&nbsp;

This visualization technique requires compromise. You cannot make your spouse do anything they don&#8217;t want to do. But, if you both want to make it work, you can help each other make changes for yourselves and each other.

# Visualization Technique to Create Opportunity:

** **

This is a visualization best done before working towards your goals on a daily basis. For example, if you are currently working on gaining customers for your business, take a moment to perform this technique before beginning your research or customer inquiries.

&nbsp;

Close your eyes and take a few deep, cleansing breaths. Try to relax and clear your mind of any questions. Think about success and what that means to you. Imagine yourself getting exactly what that entails. Visualize what is would look like, how much you would have in your bank account, and what you life would include. Now create opportunities in your mind that make those successes possible. For instance, you pass someone at a store and hear them discussing their need for exactly what you offer. You tell them about your business or service and they immediately become interested. They spread the word to their friends and within a few weeks, you go from having zero customers to having 20 regular paying customers. This gives you the opportunity to expand through advertising and you grow even bigger. You have enough now to hire a few employees and your reach extends to a larger customer pool. Later, your business

&nbsp;

really takes off and you find you can afford to expand and hire a team of experts to keep your business moving in the right direction with you at the helm.

&nbsp;

Continue to find these opportunities in your mind as if they were little doors to walk through until you achieve the ultimate success. Get creative with your visualization and really let it feel real. When you create these situations in your mind, you are inviting them to happen in reality and the universe will respond.

You&#8217;ll know when something has inspired you because you will feel it immediately. When this happens, open your eyes and get it out on paper. Always write down your inspirations no matter how silly or absurd they seem. It is this kind of inspiration that has created the amazing things we have in this world.

When you look at artwork, pictures or other images, don&#8217;t just see them, but pretend to be in them. For instance, if you look at a painting of a ship sailing across the ocean during a rough storm, imagine the movement of the deck under your feet, the feeling of the rough winds moving through your hair and tugging at your clothes. Feel the cool sea spraying mist over your face. Think about what the yells you hear and the sound of the ship creaking under the pressure. You get the idea. Do this kind of visualizing often and you will notice major changes in your ability to use your imagination in many different situations.

Listen to birds sing and taste a refreshing cup of your favorite beverage. Feel the relaxation take over all of your senses.

Some great ways to make someone&#8217;s day using this loophole is to stop worrying about their well being and act as if they are already having a perfect day. Even if things are not going well they will likely forget whatever was bothering them and feel an incredible positive energy. Rather than give someone a compliment directly, let them overhear you talking positively about them instead. It&#8217;s funny but this trick makes them feel like you really do appreciate them, enough so that you are spreading the word!

    <strong>Move Past Grief </strong>&#8211; When you feel sad or are grieving for any reason, it helps to know that you are not Nearly every single person on this planet will lose someone they care about deeply during their lives. But the truth is that when you understand the universal Law of Attraction completely, you will realize that there is no reason to grieve the death of a loved one or feel sad when you are no longer with a person you care about.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

**What to do:** Realize that you have a life to live and that pain and sadness is the opposite of what your loved one would want you to feel for very long. Of course, there is a period of time that it is okay to be sad, but then you must pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and move on for you and for the one you have lost. According to many Law of Attraction experts, our physical lives are just a fraction of what our entire experience is. We are all part of a universal energy.

&nbsp;

So know that even if your loved one is not with you on the physical plane, they are with you on an energy level. With that being said, it is okay to get back to living your life now in order to create a better vibrational energy for everyone, in this world and the next.

&nbsp;

# Affirmations to Move Past Grief:

** **

  * I move past grief to be strong for myself
  * It is okay to grieve and I know that I will be happy again
  * I choose to celebrate the life of those that have passed on
  * I am confident in my ability to heal and to create a bright future
  * I choose to grieve for my loved one by healing quickly

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Visualization Technique to Move Past Grief:

** **

Grieving is an individual process for each person. There are no two people who grieve in exactly the same way. This is why it can be difficult to help pinpoint a specific visualization technique for everyone. Use these ideas to come up with a visualization technique that will work for your own special grieving process and that matches up with your beliefs.

&nbsp;

Think about the person you are grieving over as if they were still in the room with you. Talk to them as if they were able to listen to you and try to imagine what they are saying in response. Your memories of them will help you keep them alive through speaking with them in your mind. Give them love and tell them the things you wish you told them. At first, you will be sad but after several sessions of these visualizations, you will begin to realize that you still have a part of your loved one inside of you and noone can take that away.

&nbsp;

Another wonderful visualization idea is to visualize yourself being the strong person you want to be once you move past the pain of the loss. Think about how much the person you love that has passed would want you to live your life happy and free of the grief. Do it for them as well as yourself.
