## Quotes:

> I try to be true to myself yet still at the same time look at comments and look at what the fans have to say and kind of put it in perspective. I&#8217;m never someone whose not open for opinion, I&#8217;m always just down to make it work and see how we can do things but at the end of the day I always want to make sure it represents me. It&#8217;s really about just being humble and not selling yourself on being there already
