<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><b>Ethical-Sensory Extratim &#8211; ESFj (The Enthusiast)</b>&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><i>Based upon original work by Victor Gulenko with some alterations</i>&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;"><a href="https://www.afriqueunique.org/?s=esfj">ESFjs</a> usually have a straight, upright posture and the body itself is often firm and slim. In fact it is rare to find an&nbsp;<a class="active-text" title="More about ESFj" href="https://www.afriqueunique.org/?s=esfj">ESFj<img src="http://www.socionics.com/prof/common/graph/q-mark.gif" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;with a full figure, especially a male. Their figure can also be somewhat elongated. ESFjs have a wide range of facial expressions. When receiving logical information they react with a look of extreme concentration. ESFj&#8217;s facial details are usually fine but proportional. They like to tell stories emotionally and in details. Some preferred topics of conversations are movies, art and books.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ESFjs also can show a wide range of emotions during conversation. They have very characteristic negative emotions, periodically showing indignation which can flare up without warning and which can die down just as quickly. Their negative behaviour often cannot be explained logically as they can create a drama from something that may seem unimportant. During conversation ESFjs pay close attention to the ethics and good behaviour of others. They like to give ethical evaluations and analyses on who behaved well and who did not. They also watch that the norms of politeness are obeyed. ESFjs react negatively to people who do not obey ethical norms. This is why others can sometimes consider them to be confrontational and difficult to live with. Many people believe ESFjs could be very demanding and tactless.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ESFjs have got very characteristic movements. When walking they often look like they are in a hurry. In fact, ESFjs always seem to be in a hurry. They are always going somewhere or visiting someone. They often seem to be overloaded with work that is not so urgent. They do not like to be criticised on this point and can sometimes take offence.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ESFjs take very good care of their appearance. They always show good taste in clothes, making sure that everything is in harmony and that colours are perfectly matched. When choosing clothes ESFjs always rely on their own taste. They will not purchase a fashionable item if it is not compatible with their own physique. They always wear the right clothes for the occasion.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">When explaining something ESFjs often repeat specific details again and again and keep asking if they have been understood. By doing this they can easily offend as it can seem that they think their interlocutor is stupid. However, this is not the case. ESFjs repeat themselves because they are never sure if they have been clear and logical enough. ESFjs like to talk about people they know. They easily make new friends, because of their sociability and friendly approach. From friends ESFjs demand unselfishness.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ESFjs do many things motivated by pure enthusiasm, but they always show practicality and a sharp-wit in business matters. They always try to buy the best quality goods. If these goods do not live up to their expectations they do not hesitate to complain. Items can be old but they must be of good quality. ESFjs have an excellent eye for composition and can create a warm atmosphere from nothing.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ESFjs are incredibly hospitable and are always trying to surprise their guests with something unusual. ESFjs work on the philosophy that guests should first be fed and then entertained. However they can sometimes be over the top with offers of food as they have difficulties judging when enough is enough.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier, monospace;">ESFjs pay good attention to health matters and the general well being of themselves and their family. For example, after visiting a doctor they always want an accurate diagnosis in order to decide the method of cure for themselves. When someone helps ESFjs with home matters they appreciate it very much. The fact that someone helps them is more important than the actual result.&nbsp;</span>
