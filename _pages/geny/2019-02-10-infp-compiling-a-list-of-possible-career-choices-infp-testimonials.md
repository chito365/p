Rather than compiling a list of possible career choices for the INFP, I decided to go straight to the horse’s mouth and ask other INFPs what they’re currently doing for  work. Unsurprisingly, the jobs  were incredibly varied—INFPs were represented across various different fields, but in almost

every case they spoke passionately about the career they’d chosen.

Many INFPs recalled the importance of having a job that allowed them to pursue creative goals on the side. The responses showed a thoughtful mixture of practical career choices combined with genuine passion for their work. Each INFP seemed to have found a way to create a strong sense of meaning and belonging in their field of choice.

_“I’m_ _a fiction writer. I love being able to stare into space and think, because I’m still working! I love being able to create my characters and my worlds.”_

_ _

_“I_ _am a pastor and barista. I enjoy people and seeing their potential and encouraging them through life.”_

_ _

_“I_ _work_ _in_ _finance_ _as an accounts payable clerk. I enjoy the fact that if I’m having a bad day, I can throw my headphones on and listen to button poetry or audiobooks. However, I wish I would have picked a job with a little more heart.”_

_ _

_“I_ _work_ _as a school and family counselor for children in elementary and middle school. I enjoy helping others and the ability to encourage creativity.”_

_ _

_“I_ _am a software developer for a bank. I enjoy the different challenges my role presents every day. I enjoy the abrupt changes and adapting to those_

&nbsp;

_changes, showcasing my ‘cramming’ skills.”_

_ _

_“I_ _work_ _at a not for profit. Any work I do has to be something that will directly help others. I enjoy being around people who have come through adversity or are doing their best to do so. I find it inspiring for my own journey.”_

_ _

_“I_ _make_ _ice_ _cream_ _and decorate ice cream cakes as a supplier for a small company. I don’t feel like I’m betraying myself because I don’t have to wear a uniform, endure meaningless conversations with customers, or sell things I don’t believe in. Then, all of my emotional and mental energy is kept in tact for my personal projects when I get home.”_

_ _

_“I’m_ _a translator. I enjoy learning new vocabulary every day, mainly because it forces me to read. I have issues when it comes to communicating ideas verbally, so reading helps a lot!”_

_ _

_“__I’__m a web developer. I love my work. I can put my headphones on a code for hours and no one will bother me. I love tackling a problem and looking for all the possible solutions. Coding may seem like an odd choice for an INFP, but learning coding languages was very similar to learning a foreign language, which I love.”_

_ _

_“I_ _am an artist. I try to mine the best of my ideas to help others explore different perspectives and feel better about themselves and their lives through art and tap into their inherent creative problem-solving potential.”_

_ _

_“I’m_ _in_ _school to become a social worker-I love that I get to stand up for justice and pursue people that don’t feel lovable and give them security.”_

_ _

_“I_ _do admin and customer service at a hardware store. I love the DIY inspiration I get, enjoy helping customers solve their problems and find what they’re looking for, plus the bonus of being able to hide away in the office with paperwork!”_

&nbsp;

_“I_ _teach_ _ESL_ _K-5._ _I love the connections with kids, being a ‘dream enabler’, learning about other cultures, getting to be on the front lines for children in crisis who need help and finding someone who can help them.”_

_ _

_“__I’__m now retired, working as a nature photographer. I like that I can go days without talking to anyone.”_

_ _

_“I_ _am a lawyer and professional private investigator. I love that case work draws on my drive for ‘meaning-making,’ and empathy in working with witnesses and investigation subjects, and in making meaningful stories of messy facts.”_

_ _

_“I_ _work_ _at a retail nursery. I like being alone outside with plants, daydreaming to myself, but I don’t like serving customers so I’m studying Professional Writing in hopes to become a social media marketer for an environmental non for profit one day.”_

_ _

_“__I am a property manager, and I love that the work that I do has value, but I especially love that it allows for flexibility in my time and finances to do what I really love: making music and art and baking and reading and spending time with people.”_

_ _

_“I’m_ _a high school English teacher and I love working with students who have emotional challenges.”_

_ _

_“I_ _have a non-standard INFP job—I’m a statistician. I do coach and teach on the side and love that those activities allow me to connect with people for some of my week. I’m glad that my main job isn’t people focused, though—I would be too worn out emotionally! Also, math and science jobs pay MUCH better than any sort of helping professions. I make enough that I can largely do what I want and don’t have to worry about money—this is a huge component of my overall happiness!”_

_ _

_“I_ _teach_ _guitar_ _lessons_ _part time, and I love showing kids all the cool stuff they can do with music. That moment when they really get a concept or song_

&nbsp;

_i__s wonderful to see, and the parent’s reaction to hearing their child play something by themselves is always great.”_

_ _

_“I_ _am currently a stay-at-home mom of 3 under the age of 4. I love that my often child like view of the world lets me connect deeply with my children and see things through their eyes. We have a lot of fun exploring the world and nature together.”_

_ _

_“__I’__m a librarian and I couldn’t imagine a job more suited to an INFP. It’s a mix of customer service, book reviewer researcher, community support and historian all wrapped up into one job. Plus, who wouldn’t want to spend all day surrounded by books.”_
