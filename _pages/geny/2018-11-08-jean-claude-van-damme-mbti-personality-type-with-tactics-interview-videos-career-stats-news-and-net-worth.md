          Van Damme was born Jean-Claude Camille François Van Varenberg, on 18 October 1960, in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Brussels, Belgium, the son of Eliana and Eugène Van Varenberg, who was an accountant and florist.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference">[1]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">[2]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">[3]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">[4]</sup> His father is Walloon (French-speaking) from Brussels, and his mother is Flemish (Dutch-speaking).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">[5]</sup> Van Damme&#8217;s paternal grandmother was Jewish.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">[6]</sup>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          He began martial arts at the age of ten, enrolled by his father in a Shōtōkan karate school.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">[7]</sup> His styles consist of Shōtōkan Karate and Kickboxing.<sup id="cite_ref-sfchronicle_9-0" class="reference">[8]</sup> He eventually earned his black belt in karate at 18.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">[9]</sup> He started lifting weights to improve his physique, which eventually led to a Mr. Belgium bodybuilding title.<sup id="cite_ref-playboy_11-0" class="reference">[10]</sup> At the age of 16, he took up ballet, which he studied for five years. According to Van Damme, ballet &#8220;is an art, but it&#8217;s also one of the most difficult sports. If you can survive a ballet workout, you can survive a workout in any other sport.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-chicagost_12-0" class="reference">[11]</sup> Later he took up both Taekwondo and Muay Thai.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">[12]</sup>

        <p>
          At the age of 12,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference">[13]</sup> Van Damme joined the <i>Centre National de Karaté</i> (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Claude Goetz in Belgium. Van Damme trained for four years and he earned a spot on the Belgian Karate Team; he later trained in full-contact karate and kickboxing with Dominique Valera.<sup id="cite_ref-StarSystem1_15-0" class="reference">[14]</sup>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At the age of 15, Van Damme started his competitive karate career in Belgium. From 1976 to 1980, Van Damme compiled a record of 44 victories and 4 defeats in tournament and non-tournament semi-contact matches.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Van Damme was a member of the Belgium Karate Team when it won the European Karate Championship on 26 December 1979 at La Coupe François Persoons Karate Tournament in Brussels.<sup id="cite_ref-StarSystem1_15-1" class="reference">[14]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">[15]</sup>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Van Damme placed second at the Challenge Coupe des Espoirs Karate Tournament (1st Trials). At the 3-day tournament, Van Damme defeated 25 opponents before losing in the finals to teammate Angelo Spataro.<sup id="cite_ref-StarSystem1_15-2" class="reference">[14]</sup>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          On 8 March 1980, in Brussels, Belgium, Van Damme competed against his former teammate Patrick Teugels at the Forest National Arena on the undercard of the Dan Macaruso-Dominique Valera Professional Karate Association Light-Heavyweight World Championship bout.<sup id="cite_ref-StarSystem1_15-3" class="reference">[14]</sup> Prior to this match, Teugels had defeated Van Damme twice by decision, including a match for the Belgium Lightweight Championship. Van Damme had a 1977 victory over Teugels. Teugels was coming off an impressive showing at the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations World Championships four months earlier, and was favored by some to win this match. According to reports, and Patrick Teugels&#8217; own interview (with photos), Teugels lost to Van Damme by TKO in the 1st round. Teugels was kicked in the nose and was unable to continue as a result.<sup id="cite_ref-StarSystem1_15-4" class="reference">[14]</sup> In a 2013 interview, Van Damme called this fight his most memorable match.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">[16]</sup>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Van Damme began his full-contact career in 1977, when Claude Goetz promoted the first ever full-contact karate tournament in Belgium.
