Most people don’t have a personal mission statement which is why I am including some here  
based on each Enneagram type’s innate gifts, talents, interests and values. A personal mission  
statement is nothing more than a brief written statement of your overall purpose in life, your  
personal vision for who you want to be in and for the world. Helen Keller once said, “The most  
pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but has no vision.” I would use the word  
pitiable (as in evoking compassion) instead of pathetic but otherwise I agree with her. Without a  
“why” to live for that makes a unique contribution life quickly becomes empty and meaningless.

What follows are parts of personal mission statements from Twos. You may notice a repeating  
theme.  
1. My mission is to bring more love into the world  
2. My mission is to take care of my own needs as well as I do those of others  
3. My mission is to help other women raise their self-esteem and get out of abusive  
relationships  
4. My mission is to make people feel special and loved  
5. My mission is to be the most loving spouse, mother and grandmother I can be  
6. My mission is to love my spouse and children unconditionally  
7. My mission is to give generously of myself to worthy causes and people  
8. My mission is to help people understand, appreciate and love each other  
9. My mission is to help people heal their emotional wounds  
10. My mission is to make wonderful things happen for those I love  
11. My mission is to humbly serve God by loving all of His creations
