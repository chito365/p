        Manager Bio
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        <strong>David Wagner has been Huddersfield Town&#8217;s head coach since November 2015, winning promotion to the Premier League in his first full season.</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The former forward represented United States eight times, but all of his playing career was in Germany where he was born.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In the 1996/97 season, the German won the UEFA Cup with FC Schalke 04 before playing out the rest of his career in the second tier.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Wagner&#8217;s managerial career currently spans only two clubs with his first being Borussia Dortmund II.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The German led the club from July 2011 until he left the club on 1 November 2015.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Four days later, Wagner was announced as the head coach of Championship side Huddersfield Town.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The 2015/16 season ended with the Terriers in 19th place, but an unbeaten start to the following season left Wagner&#8217;s side top in September.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A play-off place was secured at the end of the season, which consisted of a penalty shootout victory over Sheffield Wednesday after a draw in both legs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Wagner then led Huddersfield Town to the Premier League for the first time after defeating Reading 4-3 on penalties.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In his first month of managing in the Premier League, Wagner earned the August Manager of the Month award after guiding the Terriers to two victories without conceding and a goalless draw with Southampton.
      </p>
      
      <pre><strong>Concluded Personality</strong> is ISTP

ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT OTHER ONES? I’VE GOT MY THOUGHTS, BUT I’M NOT REALLY SURE OF THEM, SO I THINK I’LL WAIT FOR OTHER THEORIES ABOUT FURTHER MANAGERS (AND PLAYERS).

YOU MAY LEAVE A COMMENT BELOW, SUGGESTING YOUR BEST MATCHING MBTI PERSONALITY.</pre>
