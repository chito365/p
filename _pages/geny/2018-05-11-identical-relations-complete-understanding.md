Identical Relations are relations of complete  
understanding between partners but with an  
inability to help each other. Identical partners  
see the world with identical eyes, identically  
work out received information, come to  
identical conclusions and have identical  
problems. Identical partners usually  
experience sympathy towards each other,  
trying to support and justify each other.  
Identical relations have a negative side too.  
Interaction may quickly become boring unless  
partners have common interests, working on  
the same project, or if one partner has  
sufficient preponderance in knowledge so a  
teacher and student situation can develop.  
Especially good for secondary romances.  
Identical pairs:  
ENTp – ENTp ESFp &#8211; ESFp  
ISFp &#8211; ISFp INTp &#8211; INTp  
ESFj &#8211; ESFj ENTj &#8211; ENTj
