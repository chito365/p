Thanks Johnny Earnest for sharing this in INFJ group&#8230;Good laughs!

<span class="fbUnderline"><strong>How The Types Flirt</strong></span>

**ESTP**: Here are my genitals, wanna touch? No? Anybody else?

**ISTP**: I would like to allow you to be around me for a while. BUT NOT FOR TOO LONG, BITCH.

**ESFP**: Let&#8217;s talk about myself while doing shots. Please let me follow you around. Oh, shiny!!!

**ISFP**: Don&#8217;t pay attention to me (please pay attention to me *single tear)

**INTJ**: Would you like to hear my theory about the relationship between density and gravitational pull? No? Well, how it works is&#8230;

**INTP**: \*Shuffles around nervously\* Let&#8217;s talk about that thing we find mutually interesting in depth. Do you like comics? No. Movies? Yes?! So, I saw this movie and theoretically&#8230;

**INFP**: I won&#8217;t hook up with you, I&#8217;m pure, how dare you. (please pursue me so we can take a bath together then do BDSM)

**ENTJ**: You fascinate me. Can I ask you a bunch of questions?

**ENTP**: You fascinate me. Can I ask you a bunch of questions and make you laugh with my goofiness?**ENTP2**: Wait, you understood everything I just said? You are amazing! Date with me! \*\*continues talking about the idea\*\*

**ENFJ**: I love everything you love!!! Tell me about yourself so I can adjust my personality accordingly.

**ENFP**: I love you. I don&#8217;t know why I just know we&#8217;re connected.

**INFJ**: I can see you have a beautiful energy. Let&#8217;s go for a long walk and I&#8217;ll tell you about it.

**ESFJ**: Let&#8217;s go, like, shopping together for trendies! And then to church to confess our sins.

**ISFJ**: I did your laundry for you. Please keep me around.

**ISTJ**: \*Nervous laugh\* I would make a good partner for the following reasons

**ESTJ**: I think you&#8217;d get along well with my family, you should come to the country club this weekend

Before anyone gets offended, JOKE!

Anybody else?
