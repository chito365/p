Most people don’t have a personal mission statement which is why I am including some here  
based on each Enneagram type’s innate gifts, talents, interests and values. A personal mission  
statement is nothing more than a brief written statement of your overall purpose in life, your  
personal vision for who you want to be in and for the world. Helen Keller once said, “The most  
pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but has no vision.” I would use the word  
pitiable (as in evoking compassion) instead of pathetic but otherwise I agree with her. Without a  
“why” to live for that makes a unique contribution life quickly becomes empty and meaningless.

What follows are parts of personal mission statements from Ones. You may notice a repeating  
theme.  
1. My mission is to empower people to achieve worthwhile purposes through principlecentered  
living  
2. My mission is to teach that inner peace is the reward of faith, love, morality and service  
3. My mission is to restore the character ethic in people by leading a virtuous, honorable life  
4. My mission is to be an example of integrity, moral rectitude and balanced living for others  
to emulate  
5. My mission is to fully accept myself as perfect already so that I can fully accept others  
6. My mission is to advocate equal marriage rights for gays and lesbians  
7. My mission is to bring more integrity, justice and fairness into the legal system  
8. My mission is to reform the educational system by implementing multiple intelligences into  
the school curriculum so that each student can develop his/her unique style of giftedness  
9. My mission is to teach people how to live in alignment with their deepest values  
10. My mission is to prevent unnecessary depletion of the ozone layer
