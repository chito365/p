## <span id="Early_life" class="mw-headline">Early life</span>

Takeoff was born Kirshnik Khari Ball in Lawrenceville, Georgia, which is in Gwinnett County, near Atlanta. Along with family members Quavo and Offset, the three were raised together by his mother.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-0" class="reference">[2]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">[3]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">[4]</sup>

### <span id="Migos_.282008.E2.80.93present.29"></span><span id="Migos_(2008–present)" class="mw-headline">Migos (2008–present)</span>

Along with fellow family members Quavo and Offset, Takeoff began rapping in 2008. The group initially performed under the stage name Polo Club, but eventually changed their name to Migos. The group released their first full length project, a mixtape titled Juug Season, on August 25, 2011. They followed with the mixtape No Label, on June 1, 2012.

Migos initially rose to prominence after the release of their single &#8220;Versace&#8221;, in 2013. The song was remixed by Canadian rapper Drake and peaked at number 99 on the _Billboard_Hot 100 chart and number 31 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

Their debut studio album, _Yung Rich Nation_, was released in July 2015, and featured guest appearances from Chris Brown and Young Thug, and production from Zaytoven and Murda Beatz.<sup id="cite_ref-LN_5-0" class="reference">[5]</sup> The album peaked at number 17 on the _Billboard_ 200.

Migos achieved their first number one single in 2016 with &#8220;Bad and Boujee&#8221; featuring Lil Uzi Vert, peaking on the _Billboard_ Hot 100 during the week of January 21, 2017. The song has gone on to be certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). While he can be seen in one of the background scenes in the music video, Takeoff is not featured nor credited on the song. Takeoff himself has claimed that he was not featured on the song because he was busy at the time of recording. On June 24, 2017, during filming of _Complex_<span class="nowrap">&#8216;</span>s Everyday Struggle at the BET Awards 2017, he was questioned about his absence by hosts Joe Budden and DJ Akademiks, to which he replied, &#8220;Do it look like I&#8217;m left off &#8220;Bad and Boujee&#8221;?&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">[6]</sup> Takeoff&#8217;s response caused Budden to leave the set, and an altercation between Migos and Budden and their entourages almost took place before it was broken up by security.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2018)">citation needed</span></i>]</sup>

Migos&#8217; second studio album, _Culture_, was released on January 27, 2017, debuting at number 1 on the US _Billboard_ 200, moving 131,000 album-equivalent units, including 44,000 copies sold, during its first week of release. The album went on to achieve platinum certification in the country in July 2017.<sup id="cite_ref-Culture_Billboard_7-0" class="reference">[7]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">[8]</sup>

The group&#8217;s second album, _Culture II_, was released on January 26, 2018.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">[9]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference">[10]</sup> It became Migos&#8217; second album to debut at number 1 on the _Billboard_ 200, moving 199,000 equivalent units, including 38,000 copies sold, in its first week of release.<sup id="cite_ref-Billboard_11-0" class="reference">[11]</sup>

## <span id="Legal_issues" class="mw-headline">Legal issues</span>

### <span id="2015:_Georgia_Southern_University_incident" class="mw-headline">2015: Georgia Southern University incident</span>

On April 18, 2015, Migos were scheduled to headline Georgia Southern University&#8217;s 2015 Spring concert at Hanner Fieldhouse. The show started at 7:00 pm with local opening acts; however, the group took the stage nearly an hour and a half later than their scheduled 9:00 pm set time. Although their performance contract stipulated a minimum 45 minute set length, the group performed for less than 30 minutes before leaving the stage. The University Police Department, the Statesboro Police Department and the Bulloch County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, who were present at the concert as security detail, detected a strong scent of marijuana from the group&#8217;s vans, and the drivers were questioned by law enforcement. Upon further investigation, the rap trio and 12 members of their entourage were arrested for possession of marijuana and another controlled substance, possession of firearms within a school safety zone, possession of firearms during the commission of a crime, and possession of firearms by convicted felons.<sup id="cite_ref-S'boro_Herald_12-0" class="reference">[12]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-George-Anne_13-0" class="reference">[13]</sup>

While university officials had been aware of Migos&#8217; reputation, the group were allowed to perform as the student body had voted to have the group perform among seven acts that were up for consideration, and student fees and ticket sales were used to pay for the concert.<sup id="cite_ref-S'boro_Herald_2_14-0" class="reference">[14]</sup> According to the performance contract, the group were to be paid $30,000 with their promoter Big House Collective receiving an additional $3,000. University officials initially sought to put Migos in breach of contract due to the group&#8217;s late arrival, shortened performance, and possession of contraband on university property; however, the university ultimately paid half of the agreed upon fees.<sup id="cite_ref-WTOC_15-0" class="reference">[15]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-S'boro_Herald_3_16-0" class="reference">[16]</sup>

On April 20, 2015, Takeoff, Quavo, and six members of their entourage were released on bond by the Bulloch County District Attorney&#8217;s Office while Offset and six others remained in custody without bond. As a result of their arrests, on April 28, 2015, Migos announced they would postpone their Yung Rich Nation Tour until July.<sup id="cite_ref-Rolling_Stone_Tour_Delay_17-0" class="reference">[17]</sup>

### <span id="2017:_Atlanta_flight_incident" class="mw-headline">2017: Atlanta flight incident</span>

On July 7, 2017, Takeoff was asked to be taken off a flight from Atlanta to Des Moines, Iowa, after he reportedly refused to move his bag from the floor to an overhead storage bin prior to takeoff. <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference">[18]</sup></dt> </dl>
