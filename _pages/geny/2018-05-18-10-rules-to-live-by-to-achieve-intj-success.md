  1. Feed Your Strengths! Do things that allow your brilliant intuition and logical abilities to flourish. Explore the fascinating worlds of science, mathematics, law and medicine. Give your mind an outlet for its exceptional analytical abilities, and watch them grow.
  2. Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to overcome them. Especially, strive to use your judgment against your internal ideas and intuitions, rather than as a means of disregarding other people&#8217;s ideas.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Talk Through Your Thoughts. You need to step through your intuitions in order to put them into perspective. Give yourself time to do this, and take advantage of discussing ideas with others. You&#8217;ll find externalizing your internal intuitions to be a valuable exercise. If you don&#8217;t have someone to discuss your ideas with, try expressing your ideas clearly in writing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Take in Everything. Don&#8217;t dismiss ideas prematurely because you don&#8217;t respect the person generating the ideas, or because you think you already know it all. After all, everybody has something to offer, and nobody knows everything. Steven Covey says it so well when he says: &#8220;Seek first to understand, and then to be understood.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    When You Get Angry, You Lose. Your passion and intensity are strong assets, but can be very harmful if you allow yourself to fall into the &#8220;Anger Trap&#8221;. Remember that Anger is destructive to your personal relationships. Work through your anger before you impress it upon others, or you will likely find yourself alone. Disagreements and disappointments can only be handled effectively in a non-personal and dispassionate manner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Respect your Need for Intellectual Compatibility Don&#8217;t expect yourself to be a &#8220;touchy-feely&#8221; or &#8220;warm-fuzzy&#8221; person. Realize that your most ardent bonds with others will start with the head, rather than the heart. Be aware of other&#8217;s emotional needs, and express your genuine love and respect for them in terms that are real to YOU. Be yourself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be Accountable for Yourself. Don&#8217;t blame the problems in your life on other people. Look inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assume the Best. Don&#8217;t distress yourself and others by dwelling on the dark side of everything. Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is a light side to every dark side. Remember that positive situations are created by positive attitudes. Expect the best, and the best will come forward.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don&#8217;t Get Isolated! Recognize the value that the external world represents to you, and interact with it in the style that&#8217;s natural to you. Join clubs and internet e-mail lists that house in-depth discussions of topics that you&#8217;re interested in. Seek and foster friendships with others of like competence and capacity for understanding. Extravert in your own style.
  </li>
