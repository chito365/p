**_The_** **_Scientist_**

&nbsp;

As an INTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things rationally and logically.

&nbsp;

INTJ&#8217;s live in the world of ideas and strategic planning. They value intelligence, knowledge, and competence, and typically have high standards in these regards, which they continuously strive to fulfill. To a somewhat lesser extent, they have similar expectations of others.

&nbsp;

With Introverted Intuition dominating their personality, INTJ’s focus their energy on observing the world, and generating ideas and possibilities. Their mind constantly gathers information and makes associations about it. They are tremendously insightful and usually are very quick to understand new ideas. However, their primary interest is not understanding a concept, but rather applying that concept in a useful way. Unlike the INTP, they do not follow an idea as far as they possibly can, seeking only to understand it fully. INTJ’s are driven to come to conclusions about ideas. Their need for closure and organization usually requires that they take some action.

&nbsp;

INTJ&#8217;s tremendous value and need for systems and organization, combined with their natural insightfulness, makes them excellent scientists. An INTJ scientist gives a gift to society by putting their ideas into a useful form for others to follow. It is not easy for the INTJ to express their internal images, insights, and abstractions. The internal form of the INTJ&#8217;s thoughts and concepts is highly individualized, and is not readily translatable into a form that others will understand. However, the INTJ is driven to translate their ideas into a plan or system that is usually readily explainable, rather than to do a direct translation of their thoughts. They usually don&#8217;t see the value of a direct transaction, and will also have difficulty expressing their ideas, which are non-linear. However, their extreme respect of knowledge and intelligence will motivate them to explain themselves to another person who they feel is deserving of the effort.

&nbsp;

INTJ’s are natural leaders, although they usually choose to remain in the background until they see a real need to take over the lead. When they are in leadership roles, they are quite effective, because they are able to objectively see the reality of a situation, and are adaptable enough to change things which aren&#8217;t working well. They are the supreme strategists &#8211; always scanning available ideas and concepts and weighing them against their current strategy, to plan for every conceivable contingency.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

INTJ’s spend a lot of time inside their own minds, and may have little interest in the other people&#8217;s thoughts or feelings. Unless their Feeling side is developed, they may have problems giving other people the level of intimacy that is needed. Unless their Sensing side is developed, they may have a tendency to ignore details which are necessary for implementing their ideas.

&nbsp;

The INTJ&#8217;s interest in dealing with the world is to make decisions, express judgments, and put everything that they encounter into an understandable and rational system. Consequently, they are quick to express judgments. Often they have very evolved intuitions, and are convinced that they are right about things. Unless they complement their intuitive understanding with a well-developed ability to express their insights, they may find themselves frequently misunderstood. In these cases, INTJ’s tend to blame misunderstandings on the limitations of the other party, rather than on their own difficulty in expressing themselves. This tendency may cause the INTJ to dismiss others input too quickly, and to become generally arrogant and elitist.

&nbsp;

INTJ’s are ambitious, self-confident, deliberate, long-range thinkers. Many INTJ’s end up in engineering or scientific pursuits, although some find enough challenge within the business world in areas which involve organizing and strategic planning. They dislike messiness and inefficiency, and anything that is muddled or unclear. They value clarity and efficiency, and will put enormous amounts of energy and time into consolidating their insights into structured patterns.

&nbsp;

Other people may have a difficult time understanding an INTJ. They may see them as aloof and reserved. Indeed, the INTJ is not overly demonstrative of their affections, and is likely to not give as much praise or positive support as others may need or desire. That doesn&#8217;t mean that he or she doesn&#8217;t truly have affection or regard for others, they simply do not typically feel the need to express it. Others may falsely perceive the INTJ as being rigid and set in their ways. Nothing could be further from the truth, because the INTJ is committed to always finding the objective best strategy to implement their ideas. The INTJ is usually quite open to hearing an alternative way of doing something.<!--nextpage-->

&nbsp;

When under a great deal of stress, the INTJ may become obsessed with mindless repetitive, sensate activities, such as over-drinking. They may also tend to become absorbed with minutia and details that they would not normally consider important to their overall goal.

&nbsp;

INTJ’s need to remember to express themselves sufficiently, so as to avoid difficulties with people misunderstandings. In the absence of properly developing their communication abilities, they may become abrupt and short with people, and isolationists.

&nbsp;

INTJ’s have a tremendous amount of ability to accomplish great things. They have insight into the Big Picture, and are driven to synthesize their concepts into solid plans of action. Their reasoning skills give them the means to accomplish that. INTJ’s are most always highly competent people, and will not have a problem meeting their career or

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

education goals. They have the capability to make great strides in these arenas. On a personal level, the INTJ who practices tolerances and puts effort into effectively communicating their insights to others has everything in his or her power to lead a rich and rewarding life.

&nbsp;

**I****N****T****J’s** **generally** **have** **the** **following** **t****raits:**

&nbsp;Able to absorb extremely complex theoretical and complex material &nbsp;Driven to create order and structure from theoretical abstractions

&nbsp;Supreme strategists &nbsp;Future-oriented

&nbsp;See the global, &#8220;big picture&#8221;

&nbsp;Strong insights and intuitions, which they trust implicitly &nbsp;Value their own opinions over others

&nbsp;Love difficult theoretical challenges

&nbsp;Bored when dealing with mundane routine &nbsp;Value knowledge and efficiency

&nbsp;Have no patience with inefficiency and confusion

&nbsp;Have very high standards for performance, which they apply to themselves most strongly

&nbsp;Reserved and detached from others &nbsp;Calm, collected and analytical

&nbsp;Extremely logical and rational &nbsp;Original and independent

&nbsp;Natural leaders, but will follow those they can fully support &nbsp;Creative, ingenious, innovative, and resourceful

&nbsp;Work best alone, and prefer to work alone

&nbsp;

More so than any other personality type, INTJ’s are brilliant when it comes to grasping complex theories and applying them to problems to come up with long-term strategies. Since this type of &#8220;strategizing&#8221; is the central focus and drive of the INTJ, there is a happy match between desire and ability in this type. Accordingly, the INTJ is happiest and most effective in careers which allow this type of processing, and which promote an environment in which the INTJ is given a lot of autonomy over their daily lives.

&nbsp;

**I****N****T****J** **Relationships**

INTJ’s believe in constant growth in relationships, and strive for independence for themselves and their mates. They are constantly embarking on &#8220;fix-up&#8221; projects to improve the overall quality of their lives and relationships. They take their commitments seriously, but are open to redefining their vows, if they see something which may prove

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

to be an improvement over the existing understanding. INTJ’s are not likely to be &#8220;touchy-feely&#8221; and overly affirming with their mates or children, and may at times be somewhat insensitive to their emotional needs. However, INTJ’s are in general extremely capable and intelligent individuals who strive to always be their best, and be moving in a positive direction. If they apply these basic goals to their personal relationships, they likely to enjoy happy and healthy interaction with their families and friends.
