# <u>Advice</u>

## For Fours

  * You can help Eights engage their emotional vulnerability and soft feelings by helping them feel safe in the Eights need to know that you are loyal, trustworthy and honest before they’ll let their guarddown. If you can show loyalty and practical stability as well as steady emotions then Eight will feel safe torelax some control and share his/her heart.

&nbsp;

## For Eights

  * Fours don’t like to be controlled any more than you do so if you try to control your Four s/he will only rebel,create more conflict and make you feel like you can’t trust him/her. Learn to accept Four’s emotionalitywithout judging Allow your tender feelings to surface and provoke fights less.
