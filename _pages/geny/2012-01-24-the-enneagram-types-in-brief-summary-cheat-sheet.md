The Enneagram Types in Brief  
Type Nickname Traits Description

## 1 Reformer

**The Rational, Idealistic Type: Principled,**  
**Purposeful, Self-Controlled, and**  
**Perfectionistic**  
Ones are conscientious and ethical, with a strong sense of right and wrong. They are teachers, crusaders, and  
advocates for change: always striving to improve things, but afraid of making a mistake. Well-organized, orderly,  
and fastidious, they try to maintain high standards, but can slip into being critical and perfectionist. They typically  
have problems with resentment and impatience. At their Best: wise, discerning, realistic, and noble. Can be morally  
heroic.

## 2 Helper

 **The Caring, Interpersonal Type:**  
**Demonstrative, Generous, People- Pleasing, and Possessive**  
Twos are empathetic, sincere, and warm-hearted. They are friendly, generous, and self-sacrificing, but can also be  
sentimental, flattering, and people-pleasing. They are well-meaning and driven to be close to others, but can slip  
into doing things for others in order to be needed. They typically have problems with possessiveness and with  
acknowledging their own needs. At their Best: unselfish and altruistic, they have unconditional love for others.

## 3 Achiever

**The Success-Oriented, Pragmatic Type:**  
**Adaptive, Excelling, Driven, and Image- Conscious**  
Threes are self-assured, attractive, and charming. Ambitious, competent, and energetic, they can also be status- conscious and highly driven for advancement. They are diplomatic and poised, but can also be overly concerned  
with their image and what others think of them. They typically have problems with workaholism and  
competitiveness. At their Best: self-accepting, authentic, everything they seem to be—role models who inspire  
others.

## 4 Individualist

 **The Sensitive, Withdrawn Type:**  
**Expressive, Dramatic, Self-Absorbed, and**  
**Temperamental**  
Fours are self-aware, sensitive, and reserved. They are emotionally honest, creative, and personal, but can also be  
moody and self-conscious. Withholding themselves from others due to feeling vulnerable and defective, they can  
also feel disdainful and exempt from ordinary ways of living. They typically have problems with melancholy, selfindulgence,  
and self-pity. At their Best: inspired and highly creative, they are able to renew themselves and  
transform their experiences.

## 5 Observer

**The Intense, Cerebral Type: Perceptive,**  
**Innovative, Secretive, and Isolated**  
Fives are alert, insightful, and curious. They are able to concentrate and focus on developing complex ideas and  
skills. Independent, innovative, and inventive, they can also become preoccupied with their thoughts and imaginary  
constructs. They become detached, yet high-strung and intense. They typically have problems with eccentricity,  
nihilism, and isolation. At their Best: visionary pioneers, often ahead of their time, and able to see the world in an  
entirely new way.

## 6 Loyalist

**The Committed, Security-Oriented Type:**  
**Engaging, Responsible, Anxious, and**  
**Suspicious**  
The committed, security-oriented type. Sixes are reliable, hard-working, responsible, and trustworthy. Excellent  
&#8220;troubleshooters,&#8221; they foresee problems and foster cooperation, but can also become defensive, evasive, and  
anxious—running on stress while complaining about it. They can be cautious and indecisive, but also reactive,  
defiant and rebellious. They typically have problems with self-doubt and suspicion. At their Best: internally stable  
and self-reliant, courageously championing themselves and others

## 7 Enthusiast

 **The Busy, Fun-Loving Type: Spontaneous,**  
**Versatile, Distractible, and Scattered**  
Sevens are extroverted, optimistic, versatile, and spontaneous. Playful, high-spirited, and practical, they can also  
misapply their many talents, becoming over- extended, scattered, and undisciplined. They constantly seek new and  
exciting experiences, but can become distracted and exhausted by staying on the go. They typically have problems  
with impatience and impulsiveness. At their Best: they focus their talents on worthwhile goals, becoming  
appreciative, joyous, and satisfied.

## 8 Champion

 **The Powerful, Dominating Type: Self- Confident, Decisive, Willful, and**  
**Confrontational**  
Eights are self-confident, strong, and assertive. Protective, resourceful, straight-talking, and decisive, but can also  
be ego-centric and domineering. Eights feel they must control their environment, especially people, sometimes  
becoming confrontational and intimidating. Eights typically have problems with their tempers and with allowing  
themselves to be vulnerable. At their Best: self- mastering, they use their strength to improve others&#8217; lives,  
becoming heroic, magnanimous, and inspiring.

## 9 Peacemaker

 **The Easygoing, Self-Effacing Type:**  
**Receptive, Reassuring, Agreeable, and**  
**Complacent**  
Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable. They are usually creative, optimistic, and supportive, but can also be too  
willing to go along with others to keep the peace. They want everything to go smoothly and be without conflict, but  
they can also tend to be complacent, simplifying problems and minimizing anything upsetting. They typically have  
problems with inertia and stubbornness. At their Best: indomitable and all-embracing, they are able to bring people  
together and heal conflicts.
