Some INFJâ€™s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with not knowing (or caring) how they come across to others, and with having unreasonable expectations for others&#8217; behaviors. Both of these issues stem from using Extraverted Feeling primarily to dismiss external ideas, rather than to sort through their own intuitions.

&nbsp;

An INFJ who uses Extraverted Feeling in this diminished manner may become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations for others. They may feel so strongly about things that they become very passionate and agitated when they feel that something has gone wrong. In these cases, it&#8217;s not uncommon for the INFJ to express their displeasure with biting sarcasm. They become so emotionally upset that they are generally not aware of how their behavior comes across to others. Even if the consequences of their attitude and behavior are pointed out to them, they may be agitated to the point that they don&#8217;t care. This kind of situation can be devastating to the INFJ on many levels, and should be avoided. There isn&#8217;t much that can be done once the INFJ has reached the point where they are too upset to

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

care about others, but the INFJ can prevent this problem from occurring by ensuring that they never get to that point.

&nbsp;

How can you, as an INFJ, ensure that you won&#8217;t get that upset? It probably seems to you that these kinds of upsets are caused by external circumstances and situations. Well, that&#8217;s not really true. It&#8217;s true that things will happen over which you have no control. But you certainly have control over how you perceive these things, or more appropriately, how you \*judge\* these things.

&nbsp;

**S****p****ecific** **suggestions:**

Take care to listen to someone&#8217;s idea entirely before you pass judgment on it. Ask questions if necessary. Do whatever it takes to make sure that you understand the idea. Try not to begin judging anything about the idea until you have understood it entirely.

&nbsp;

Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person. Take in that person&#8217;s attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with whom you&#8217;re speaking.

&nbsp;

If you become upset, walk away immediately. DO NOT express anger. When you get angry, you lose. After you have calmed down, apologize for leaving and continue with what you were doing.

&nbsp;

Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter frequently in your life. Remember that people with the Sensing preference need to be communicated with in a direct, concise manner. Speak plainly and simply with Sensors, giving &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; answers.

&nbsp;

Try to be on good terms with all people, even those that you consider beneath you. Try to understand that everybody has something to offer.
