**1.&nbsp;[Se &#8211; extroverted Sensing](https://www.afriqueunique.org/?s=SE)**  
Se is the main way SeFi’s take in information. It means they use their senses to understand the world around them. They live in the moment and prefer dealing with things that are real and solid over the purely hypothetical. Se is the part of SeFi’s that makes them search out playful new sensory experiences.

**2. [Fi &#8211; introverted Feeling](https://www.afriqueunique.org/?s=FI)**  
Although it’s referred to as “Feeling”, Fi is not internal emotions, but rather values that come from within. SeFi’s might experience a deep well of emotions, but this is not the root of Fi. It is a decision making-process that makes them very interested in determining their own moral code and what the SeFi’s gut instinct tells them is right, which is often based on how they would like to be treated themselves. They tend to be very considerate of others, and may take a long time to mull over their own beliefs to make sure they seem right. The values-refining process can take quite a bit of time and requires mental solitude. Fi generally puts authenticity in high esteem and is repulsed by anything that seems fabricated or shallow.

**3. [Te &#8211; extroverted Thinking](https://www.afriqueunique.org/?s=TE)**  
Te is the SeFi’s third &nbsp;function. Te is a very logic-oriented way of problem solving. It is the side of them that naturally looks to find a better solution to a problem, improve the efficiency of a process, or critique and refine what is already in place. SeFi’s are pretty balanced between this quick, decisive efficient way of making decisions and the pondering, value-driven decision making process of their Fi.

**4. [Ni &#8211; introverted iNtuition](https://www.afriqueunique.org/?s=NI)**  
Ni is the SeFi’s last function and may be their achilles heel, and is inherently not as strong as their other functions because their highest priority and focus is on Se. Ni allows them to pull from every area in their brain to find valuable data, to look for patterns in the information they gather, or to skip ten steps ahead and predict what will happen in the future. Ni makes their internal world abstract and can involve jumping around on intuitive leaps. In the SeFi, Ni might give them the sense that it’s okay to not have everything figured out. Overuse of an inferior function can be very draining, and may be unhealthy when constantly given priority over other functions.
