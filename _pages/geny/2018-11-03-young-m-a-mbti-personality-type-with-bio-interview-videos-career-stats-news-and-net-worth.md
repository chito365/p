Young M.A was born on April 3, 1992, in Brooklyn, New York. She is of Puerto Rican and Jamaican descent. Her father is Puerto Rican and her mother is Jamaican. She began rapping at the age of 9 and further developed her talents over the next nine years, while she was residing in Virginia. She has never stayed in one place for long, moving to several cities in the South. At the age of 16, she moved back to Brooklyn.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-0" class="reference">[7]</sup>

### <span id="Music" class="mw-headline">Music</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span>

When she was a child, Young M.A already had a passion for music. As an adult her music career started. She self-funded a recording studio with local record producers while working at Shake Shack and T.J. Maxx.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_8-0" class="reference">[8]</sup>

In 2014 she gained notoriety when a Facebook post criticized her song &#8220;Brooklyn Chiraq&#8221;, a freestyle to Nicki Minaj and G Herbo &#8220;ChiRaq&#8221;; the song then went viral.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_9-0" class="reference">[9]</sup> The post&#8217;s author, pundit Boyce Watkins, said the song promoted &#8220;violent, negative, genocidal energy&#8221;, but the controversy expanded Young M.A&#8217;s name recognition and brought new listeners to her work.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-1" class="reference">[7]</sup>

In 2015, Young M.A released a new song, called &#8220;Body Bag&#8221;, which became a &#8220;YouTube hit&#8221;, said _Rolling Stone,_<sup id="cite_ref-:1_9-1" class="reference">[9]</sup> along with the release of her mixtape called _Sleep Walkin<span class="nowrap">&#8216;</span>_, which MTV described as a &#8220;thoughtful debut project&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_10-0" class="reference">[10]</sup>

In 2016, Young M.A released her official debut single, &#8220;Ooouuu&#8221;,<sup id="cite_ref-:4_8-1" class="reference">[8]</sup> which peaked at number 19 on the US _Billboard_ Hot 100 chart.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">[11]</sup> In September 2016, the song had nearly 7 million plays on Spotify<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">[12]</sup> and was widely remixed by other rappers and hip hop artists such as Nicki Minaj, French Montana, Remy Ma, Jadakiss, Uncle Murda, ASAP Ferg, Bryan Mathers and Tink, all of whom released their versions of the song.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-2" class="reference">[7]</sup>

Stereogum&#8217;s Tom Breihan said &#8220;Ooouuu&#8221; was &#8220;a brash, intense, hard-as-fuck piece of rider music&#8230; the song feels like it marks the arrival of a major rap talent.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">[13]</sup> _The Fader_ said Young M.A has &#8220;establishe[d] herself as a quintessential New York MC&#8221;,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference">[14]</sup> and MTV&#8217;s Doreen St. Félix said, &#8220;This summer, the atmosphere belongs to Young M.A and her single &#8216;OOOUUU.'&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-:2_10-1" class="reference">[10]</sup> The song&#8217;s popularity drew attention from labels, though M.A remains an independent artist.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">[15]</sup>

At the 2016 BET Hip Hop Awards, she performed a freestyle on a cypher and performed &#8220;Ooouuu&#8221;, giving what _XXL Magazine_ described as &#8220;show-stopping freestyle&#8230; one of the best freestyles of the night&#8221;. Despite the enthusiasm for her performance, Young M.A expressed disappointment, saying BET cut out a portion of her performance.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">[16]</sup> Remy Mafeatured M.A at Hot 97’s Summer Jam 2017, where she performed alongside other female rap greats. “There’s been a lot of opportunities, and of course a lot of money,” M.A says. “But then there’s the downside: you lose a lot of people that were once around you once their true colors start to show.”

While M.A has remained consistent since her debut single dropped, her debut album is anticipated to reveal a culmination of the artist’s experiences before and since the release of “OOOUUU”. Freestyles such as “Who Run It”<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">[17]</sup> and “I Get The Bag”<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference">[18]</sup> have gained millions of online streams and views, along with her previous single, “Walk”,<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference">[19]</sup> which has amassed over 20 million listens. M.A’s latest release is titled, “Praktice”,<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference">[20]</sup> a reference to the idea that her previous releases have all led up to the full album, PettyWap is her latest single.

### <span id="Other_projects" class="mw-headline">Other projects</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span>

In 2016, in an interview with _Rolling Stone_, Young M.A said she&#8217;d been offered the role of Freda Gatz (whose name was originally supposed to be Betty Bars, because the role was made especially for her) on _Empire_, but turned it down, preferring to pursue her own career as a rapper instead of being known first as a fictional character.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_9-2" class="reference">[9]</sup> She even referenced being offered the role in her freestyle &#8220;Check&#8221;,<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference">[21]</sup> rapping, &#8220;Shout out to Fox, trying to get me on that Empire, at first I had to turn it down, wasn&#8217;t up to par, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s Young M.A b*\*\\*\*, &#8216;the f\*\** is Betty Bars?&#8221; Young M.A. makes it clear that the only reason she turned down the offer was that she wanted to first establish her role as an &#8220;artist in the industry&#8221; and not as an &#8220;industry artist&#8221; (as Russ would call it) by making a name for herself through her music and gain recognition and ultimately solidify her presence in the entertainment industry.

In 2018, she directed her first movie which was a lesbian porn produced by Pornhub.

In the midst of prepping her album for a Fall 2018 release, M.A has also formed the Kweens Foundation. “It’s for women and for men—Kings and Queens…Kweens,” she says. “I got my mother involved because she sadly lost her son, my brother, in 2009 and this is something for her to get into and give her a little relief and meet other mothers who have been in that situation so they’re not alone.” Everything M.A achieves is autobiographical, right down to philanthropy. “No matter how much success you have in this life, you still go through those struggles and still go through that pain.”<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">[22]</sup>

## <span id="Personal_life" class="mw-headline">Personal life</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span>edit<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span>

Young M.A is a lesbian,<sup id="cite_ref-:3_23-0" class="reference">[23]</sup> a topic that she includes in her music. She told _Vogue_ that coming out had been an important point in her artistic development, saying &#8220;I held in being sexually attracted to women for so long that once I got that out of me, the music became easy.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-3" class="reference">[7]</sup> Young M.A. said in a YouTube video that not only was she proud of being different, but also proclaimed that it&#8217;s not about who you are or what your sexual orientation is &#8211; it&#8217;s about making music to bring people closer together and to feel the beat running through their skin.

Young M.A. knew she was lesbian at age 9 and admits she felt out of place. She played football and hung around guys a lot as a child and her mother would often try to get her to come out, but she would always deny it. She thought her mother wouldn&#8217;t accept her if she came out. In an interview with &#8216;The Breakfast Club&#8217; she said,<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference">[24]</sup>&#8220;I used to be scared to tell my moms&#8230; because I knew my moms wasn&#8217;t the type of mother to be like &#8216;Oh, I don&#8217;t like you&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m gonna ignore you,&#8217; but part of me still was scared.&#8221; She also said in an interview with Noisey Raps, &#8220;Since I came out officially, that&#8217;s when all the girls flopped, that&#8217;s when it was a wrap,&#8221; she laughed. She also said people &#8220;feel her more&#8221; because she&#8217;s more comfortable.

In September 2009, when Young M.A was 17, her older brother Kenneth was killed in gang-related violence in Pennsylvania; he was 20.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_1-1" class="reference">[1]</sup> She fell into a deep depression after his death.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference">[25]</sup>

Young M.A. appears regularly at the end of Vice News Tonight (on HBO) episodes critiquing many genres of music.

She has also appeared on the Wendy Williams Show, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Viceland&#8217;s &#8220;The Therapist&#8221;, Snoop Dogg&#8217;s GGN, MTV&#8217;s Ridiculousness, Hip Hop Squares, Martha & Snoop&#8217;s Potluck Dinner Party, Wild &#8216;n Out, Safeword (on MTV), and Total Request Live (TRL
