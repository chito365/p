  1. **_Love&nbsp;_**
  2. **_Feed Your Strengths!_**&nbsp;Do things that allow your brilliant intuition and service-oriented manner to flourish.
  3. **_Face Your Weaknesses!_**&nbsp;See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to overcome them. Especially, strive to use your judgment against your internal ideas and intuitions, rather than as a means of disregarding other people&#8217;s ideas.
  4. **_Talk Through Your Thoughts._**&nbsp;You need to step through your intuitions in order to put them into perspective. Give yourself time to do this, and take advantage of discussing ideas with others. You&#8217;ll find externalizing your internal intuitions to be a valuable exercise.
  5. **_Take in Everything._**&nbsp;Don&#8217;t dismiss ideas prematurely because you don&#8217;t respect the person generating the ideas, or because you think you already know it all. After all, everybody has something to offer, and nobody knows everything. Steven Covey says it so well when he says: &#8220;Seek first to understand, and then to be understood.&#8221;
  6. **_When You Get Angry, You Lose._**&nbsp;Your passion and intensity are strong assets, but can be very harmful if you allow yourself to fall into the &#8220;Anger Trap&#8221;. Remember that Anger is destructive to your personal relationships. Work through your anger before you impress it upon others, or you will likely find yourself alone. Disagreements and disappointments can only be handled effectively in a non-personal and dispassionate manner.
  7. **_Keep Your Eye on the Big Picture_**&nbsp;Watch out for your tendency to become obsessed with details. If you find yourself feeling very, very strongly about a small detail, take a big step back and make sure that you can still see the goal. You&#8217;re not going to get there if you get mired in the details.
  8. **_Be Accountable for Yourself._**&nbsp;Don&#8217;t blame the problems in your life on other people. Look inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.
  9. **_Be Humble._**&nbsp;Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.
 10. **_Assume the Best._**&nbsp;Don&#8217;t distress yourself and others by dwelling on the dark side of everything. Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is a light side to every dark side. Remember that positive situations are created by positive attitudes. Expect the best, and the best will come forward.
 11. **_Relax!_**&nbsp;Do yourself a favor and learn how to effectively unwind. Get exercise and restful sleep. Take vacations. Engage in relaxing activities. Take care of yourself and your loved ones by learning to let go of your passion and intensity for a respite.

Thank You!
