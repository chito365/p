This information could be coming from the objective external reality (Extroverted perception), or the person’s subjective worldview (Introverted perception). Discernment functions take information from the perception, and then use it to make decisions. These decisions could be the subjective and reactionary analysis of how one feels or considers the information they are getting (introverted Judgment), or the setting of objective courses of action (Extroverted Judgment). </span>

    <span data-offset-key="9oekk-0-0">In order for a person to function at all, they must be able to have a way to engage the external world (Extroversion), a way to engage the internal world (Introversion), a means of gaining information (Perception), and a way to make decisions (Judgment.) Therefore, Extrovert Judgment and Introverted perception, or Introverted Judgment and Extroverted Perception would be the minimal criteria to have a functional apparatus. However, while this minimum is technically functional, a person must satisfy the 4 priorities to actually have a mature and adaptable apparatus.</span>

    <span data-offset-key="7jr0c-0-0">Dynamics is what a person reaches into when they need to output objective external structure, or take in objective external structure. Dynamics functions are directive functions that focus on the objective dynamics of an external system. Fe focuses on the system of social dynamics, how everyone feels about what, and how they can be directed into feeling something else. Te focuses on the dynamics of the objective systems of logical protocol, how something is working, and how it can direct others to operating an objective system. There is a “Push” and “Push back” that occurs when the Dynamics functions are being used. “Push” is what happens when the an action is taken by an external decision, and “Push Back” is the detection of how the external dynamics are currently operating. The Dynamics functions also serve as a person’s articulator, as it takes a person’s subjective thoughts and perceptions and turns it into a structured, objective, and external language. Because of this, personality types with dominant dynamics functions, such as the ENTJ or ESFJ for example, will be able to articulate with the most ease and types with inferior dynamics functions will have the most trouble with articulation. It is also the Dominant Dynamics types that need this articulation in order to help clarify their own thoughts and understandings. They start by “pushing” their perspectives onto others, and then when they are pushed back by the outside world, they introvert to check with their worldview to see why they got the “Push back” reaction that they did. Once they see the solution then they “Push” again, and the cycle continuous.</span>

    <span data-offset-key="2idfe-0-0">A person’s worldview is their own personal and subjective perception of the way the world works and the way it should work. This is where a person’s personal map of life is held; their understanding and knowledge of all that is true in the world. The Worldview functions are both Directive functions, as they are a preset agenda that serves as the homeostasis of internal information for a person’s psyche. Si is a worldview that is based on a person’s history and memories of how things were in their past, and it’s agenda is to make the present match this past image. Ni is worldview that is based on a person’s map of abstract patterns, natural law, and how things will unfold in the future, and it’s agenda is to turn the present into this future model. The worldview is what a person looks into when they check to see where things are going. When a pattern or event happens in real time, then a person must check their worldview to be able to recognize what is happening now and where it is going to go. When anyone makes plans, or sets timetables for courses of action, it must be logged into their worldview function so they can set a time based playlist of actions. Personality types with dominant worldview functions, such as the ISTJ or INFJ, use their worldview to see the best course of actions, and then use their dynamics function to execute these actions. However, they put far more time and focus into the internal planning phase, which why when a dominant Worldview type “Pushes”, their push is much harder than a dominant dynamics type. For a dominant worldview type, the act of “pushing” is a draining action and would much rather have it only take one shot, so they are not looking to dance, they are looking to win.</span>

    <span data-offset-key="a0gu7-0-0">Stimulus functions are how a person takes in new objective and/or external information as it is happening now. These functions that a person uses to be “in the now” so to speak and they gain awareness for present change and flow. Stimulus functions are adaptive because they only follow information as it is coming. They ride the wave of new emerging external data, instead of try to direct where it is going. Se takes in objective information gained by the five senses, exactly as the details are in a literal sense. Ne takes in information based on emerging patterns, possibilities, and trends that are emerging in real time. When something occurs in the present, Ne detects its patterns and then jumps to where the next step could possibly be. Personality types with dominant stimulus functions, such as the ENTP and ESFP, live in the moment and are most energized by experiencing the events emerging in real time. The surf the waves of the changing external environment, and use their Auxiliary Introverted Judgment function as a rudder to guild how they process the information gained.</span>

    <span data-offset-key="eh9h9-0-0">The Compass functions are how a person weighs new information gained by a perception function, based on a subjective model of personal values or logic. The Compasses react to inputted information through a process of “resonation”. They will resonate in such a way that tells the psyche whether they agree or disagree with the information. The compasses are adaptive in that they are reactionary and interface with information that is thrown at them in real time. Ti will resonate with information when it aligns strongly with it’s personal logic, and reject information when it’s logic is weak. Fi will Resonate with information with it aligns with its personal values, and reject information that does not. Both Ti and Fi have a very “yuck” sort of reaction when posed with disagreeable information, that tells a person right away where they stand on it, and what problems they have with it. Personality types that have a Compass function as their dominant function, such as the INTP and ISFP, are very reflective, and gain most of their energy by modeling their internal logic or values. They can also augment their Compass functions when met with other types that have compass models that they agree with. Effectively, and INTP for example can agree with a piece of an ENTP’s logical model, and then integrate that into their own. However, the models created by the compasses are amorphous and unstructured, which is why they are the hardest to describe and turn into structure and articulated language. </span>
