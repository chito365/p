If we must act effectively, we must deal with the world as it is, face the problems as they arise with out wait, and if we agree that [Africa](www.oscarkemboi.xyz/?search=africa) had 300 million people in 1963 and had the same problems that we have today with 1.2 Billion people on the continent and over 178 million African Diaspora then we must cease this act of procrastinatingabout African Unity, For we must Unite Now to face all the Challenges wholly as a people. We have the greatest and second Greatest resource, The human and Material. These should be marshaled up wholly for the benefit of all African people.
