## Bio & Career stats:

**O&#8217;Shea Jackson Sr.** (born June 15, 1969), known professionally as **Ice Cube**, is an American rapper, writer and actor.

Ice Cube initially gained recognition as a member of the hip hop group C.I.A. in 1984, which gained limited commercial success prior to disbanding three years later. Ice Cube, alongside Dr. Dre and Eazy E, then formed the group N.W.A, where he gained extreme notoriety as the group&#8217;s primary songwriter and performer, noted for becoming one of the founding artists of gangsta rap, and pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music, as well as visual imagery in music videos.<sup id="cite_ref-Ice_Cube_2002_1-0" class="reference">[1]</sup>

After leaving N.W.A in December 1989, Ice Cube embarked on a successful solo career, releasing the albums _AmeriKKKa&#8217;s Most Wanted_ (1990) and _Death Certificate_ (1991), both of which have attained platinum certification in the United States, while also being classed as defining albums of the 1990s.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference">[2]</sup> Much of his musical output has contained harsh socio-political commentary and storytelling, which has earned him several accolades from multiple publications and artists, often being cited as a consistent influence, as well as one of the best rappers of all time.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">[3]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference">[4]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference">[5]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">[6]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference">[7]</sup>

Following the release of _Death Certificate_, Ice Cube&#8217;s popularity was further enhanced by his role in _Boyz n the Hood_ (1991), where his performance as one of the titular characters was heavily praised. He also wrote and starred in the _Friday_ film series, which contributed to reinventing his public image as a movie star. Ice Cube has also featured in the _Barbershop_, _Ride Along_, and _XXX_ film series, while also serving as a producer to several other films, including _Straight Outta Compton_ (2015), a biographical film depicting the career of N.W.A.

As a businessman, Ice Cube has founded his clothing line, Solo by Cube, as well as the 3 on 3 basketball league BIG3, which predominately features retired NBA players.

O&#8217;Shea Jackson was born on June 15, 1969, in Baldwin Hills, South Central Los Angeles, the son of Doris, a hospital clerk and custodian, and Hosea Jackson, who worked as a groundskeeper at UCLA and a machinist.<sup id="cite_ref-Jessie_Carney_Smith_2006_8-0" class="reference">[8]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">[9]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-hiphop.sh_10-0" class="reference">[10]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">[11]</sup> He has an older brother<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">[12]</sup> as well as a half-sister who was murdered when Ice Cube was 12.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">[13]</sup> His cousin is Teren Delvon Jones, also known as Del tha Funky Homosapien, who is a part of the rap group Hieroglyphics and who has also worked with Gorillaz; another cousin is Kam of rap group The Warzone. In his early teens, Ice Cube developed an interest in hip hop music, and began writing raps in Los Angeles George Washington Preparatory High School&#8217;s typewriting class.<sup id="cite_ref-Fresh_Air_14-0" class="reference">[14]</sup> Jackson penned his first rap song in the ninth grade after a friend named &#8220;Kiddo&#8221;, challenged him to write a song during a typewriting class. Kiddo lost.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">[15]</sup> On the origins of his rapper name, Ice Cube says that it came from his older brother. He is quoted as saying &#8220;He threatened to slam me into a freezer and pull me out when I was an ice cube. I just started using that name, and it just caught on.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">[16]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">[17]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference">[18]</sup>

At the age of 16, Jackson sold his first song to future N.W.A. member Eazy-E.<sup id="cite_ref-Jessie_Carney_Smith_2006_8-1" class="reference">[8]</sup> Jackson also attended William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California.<sup id="cite_ref-Jessie_Carney_Smith_2006_8-2" class="reference">[8]</sup> He enrolled at the Phoenix Institute of Technology in the fall of 1987 in Arizona. Being passionate about architecture, he studied architectural drafting.<sup id="cite_ref-Jessie_Carney_Smith_2006_8-3" class="reference">[8]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-BlackCollegian_19-0" class="reference">[19]</sup> He completed his diploma within one year and returned to Los Angeles to pursue a rap career. Not sure of whether his rap career would work out, he would turn to become an architecture draftsman as a career backup.<sup id="cite_ref-Jessie_Carney_Smith_2006_8-4" class="reference">[8]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference">[20]</sup>

With friend Sir Jinx, Ice Cube formed the C.I.A., and they performed at parties hosted by Dr. Dre. Dre soon entered the recording industry as a member of the World Class Wreckin&#8217; Cru. Dre saw Cube&#8217;s potential as a writer and had him assist with writing Wreckin Cru&#8217;s big L.A. hit track, &#8220;Cabbage Patch&#8221; as well as joining Cube on a side partnership which the duo called Stereo Crew. Stereo Crew produced a twelve-inch record, &#8220;She&#8217;s a Skag&#8221; released on Epic Records in 1986.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference">[21]</sup>

While Dr. Dre was DJing at L.A. dance club Eve After Dark, Ice Cube would rap over his music, often parodying songs by other artists. One such example of this was the song &#8220;My Penis,&#8221; a parody of Run-DMC&#8217;s &#8220;My Adidas.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">[22]</sup> In a 2015 interview, club-owner Alonzo Williams said that he felt that this song damaged his reputation and asked for it not to be performed.<sup id="cite_ref-Lonzo_23-0" class="reference">[23]</sup>

In 1987, Ice Cube released the Dr. Dre produced single _My Posse_ under with his group C.I.A. (Cru&#8217; In Action!). After the collaboration, Ice Cube showed Eazy-E the lyrics to &#8220;Boyz-n-the-Hood&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-Allmusic_24-0" class="reference">[24]</sup> Eazy-E, although initially rejecting the lyrics, eventually recorded the song for _N.W.A. and the Posse_, the debut album for the group N.W.A that also included Dr. Dre, MC Ren, and DJ Yella. Ice Cube was the only member of N.W.A who is not from Compton, California (where it was formed).

By this point Ice Cube was a full-time member of N.W.A along with Dr. Dre and MC Ren. Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre&#8217;s and Eazy-E&#8217;s rhymes for the group&#8217;s landmark album, _Straight Outta Compton_, released in 1988. However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group&#8217;s manager, Jerry Heller, after rejecting Heller&#8217;s proposed contract terms.<sup id="cite_ref-Ice_Cube_2002_1-1" class="reference">[1]</sup>

Ice Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both _Straight Outta Compton_, and Eazy-E&#8217;s solo album, _Eazy-Duz-It_, but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<sup id="cite_ref-Attitude70_25-0" class="reference">[25]</sup> This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<sup id="cite_ref-Attitude70_25-1" class="reference">[25]</sup> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP _100 Miles and Runnin&#8217;_, and on their next and final album, _Niggaz4Life_.

### <span id="Solo_career:_1989.E2.80.93present"></span><span id="Solo_career:_1989–present" class="mw-headline">Solo career: 1989–present</span>

In 1989, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, _AmeriKKKa&#8217;s Most Wanted_, in New York with the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy&#8217;s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap&#8217;s popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed the female rapper Yo-Yo (who appeared on _AmeriKKKa&#8217;s Most Wanted_) to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, _Make Way for the Motherlode_. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in John Singleton&#8217;s violent crime drama, _Boyz n the Hood_. In the same year as _AmeriKKKa&#8217;s Most Wanted_, Ice Cube released the acclaimed EP, _Kill At Will_ which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go Platinum.<sup id="cite_ref-Allmusic_24-1" class="reference">[24]</sup>

His second album _Death Certificate_ was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the &#8216;Death Side&#8217; (&#8220;a vision of where we are today&#8221;) and the &#8216;Life Side&#8217; (&#8220;a vision of where we need to go&#8221;). It features &#8220;No Vaseline&#8221;, a scathing response to N.W.A&#8217;s &#8221;100 Miles and Runnin&#8221; as well as &#8220;Black Korea,&#8221; a track regarded by some as prophetic of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, but also interpreted as racist by many.<sup id="cite_ref-Allmusic_24-2" class="reference">[24]</sup> Ice Cube toured with Lollapalooza in 1992, which widened his fan base.<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian_26-0" class="reference">[26]</sup>

Ice Cube released his third album, _The Predator_, in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year&#8217;s Los Angeles riots, in the first single, &#8220;Wicked&#8221;, he rapped &#8220;April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel&#8221;. _The Predator_ debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from _The Predator_ included &#8220;It Was a Good Day&#8221; and &#8220;Check Yo Self&#8221;, and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after _The Predator_, Ice Cube&#8217;s rap audience diminished. Cube&#8217;s fourth album _Lethal Injection_, which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube&#8217;s first attempt at imitating the G-Funk sound of Dr. Dre&#8217;s _The Chronic_, was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from _Lethal Injection_, including &#8220;Really Doe&#8221;, &#8220;Bop Gun (One Nation)&#8221;, &#8220;You Know How We Do It&#8221; & &#8220;What Can I Do?&#8221;. After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, Kausion, and Da Lench Mob.<sup id="cite_ref-Allmusic_24-3" class="reference">[24]</sup>

In 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member Dr. Dre, who was now part of Death Row Records, in their duet &#8220;Natural Born Killaz&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-Allmusic_24-4" class="reference">[24]</sup> In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, _War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)_. The delayed sixth album, _Volume 2_, was released in 2000. The albums featured appearances from Westside Connection as well as a reunion with fellow N.W.A members, Dr. Dre and MC Ren, though many fans maintained that the two albums were not on par with his past work, especially the second volume.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference">[27]</sup> In 2000, Ice Cube also joined Dr. Dre, Eminem & Snoop Dogg for the Up in Smoke Tour.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference">[28]</sup>

In 2006, Ice Cube released his seventh solo album, _Laugh Now, Cry Later_, on his Lench Mob Records label, debuting at number four on the Billboard Charts and selling 144,000 units in the first week.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference">[29]</sup> The album featured production from Lil Jon and Scott Storch, who produced the lead single &#8220;Why We Thugs&#8221;. He released his eighth studio album, Raw Footage, on August 19, 2008, featuring the controversial single &#8220;Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It&#8221;.

On October 12, 2009, he released a non-album track called &#8216;Raider Nation&#8217; in tribute to the Oakland Raiders.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference">[30]</sup>

On May 11, 2010, Ice Cube released a 30 for 30 documentary, &#8220;Straight Outta L.A.&#8221;, for ESPN on the relationship between the gangsta rap scene in Los Angeles and the tenure of the Raiders there.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference">[31]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference">[32]</sup> He has been voted as eighth of MTV&#8217;s &#8220;greatest emcees of all time.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-eighth_33-0" class="reference">[33]</sup>

On September 28, 2010, Ice Cube released his ninth solo album, _I Am the West_. The album featured the single &#8220;I Rep That West&#8221;. It debuted at #22 on the _Billboard_ 200 and sold 22,000 copies in its first week.

In September 2012, Ice Cube released his second anthem for the Oakland Raiders, &#8220;Come and Get It&#8221;, as a part of Pepsi&#8217;s NFL Anthems campaign.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference">[34]</sup>

### <span id="Westside_Connection:_1996.E2.80.932007"></span><span id="Westside_Connection:_1996–2007" class="mw-headline">Westside Connection: 1996–2007</span>

In 1996, Ice Cube formed Westside Connection with Mack 10 and WC, and together they released an album called _Bow Down_. Some of the album was used to engage in the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry of the 1990s. The album&#8217;s eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified Platinum by the end of 1996. With _Bow Down_, Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like &#8220;Bow Down&#8221; and &#8220;Gangstas Make the World Go &#8216;Round&#8221; make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with Eazy-E shortly before his death in March 1995.

After a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort _Terrorist Threats_ in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of _Bow Down_. &#8220;Gangsta Nation&#8221; was the only single released from the album, which was produced by Fredwreck and featured Nate Dogg; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube&#8217;s commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.

### <span id="Collaborations:_1992.E2.80.93present"></span><span id="Collaborations:_1992–present" class="mw-headline">Collaborations: 1992–present</span>

He handled most of the production on _Guerillas in tha Mist_.

In 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, _Planet of tha Apes_. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with Tupac Shakur on his album _Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.,_ appearing on the track &#8220;Last Wordz&#8221; with Ice-T.

He also lent his voice to British DJ Paul Oakenfold&#8217;s solo debut album, _Bunkka_, on the track &#8220;Get Em Up&#8221;. Ice Cube appeared in several songs in WCGuilty by Affiliation like &#8220;Keep it 100&#8221;, &#8220;80&#8217;s babies&#8221; and &#8220;Jack and the bean stalk&#8221;.

In 2004, he appeared in the Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz song, &#8220;Real Nigga Roll Call&#8221;. In late 2005, Ice Cube and R. J. Cutler teamed up to create the six-part documentary series titled _Black. White._, which was broadcast on cable network FX. In May 2006 Ice Cube complained that Oprah Winfrey would not welcome him and other rappers on her show.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference">[35]</sup> Ice Cube&#8217;s other movie projects include _Teacher of the Year_, released in 2007,<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_36-0" class="reference">[36]</sup> and _The Extractors_, released in 2008.

He has signed on to star in and produce _Welcome Back, Kotter_, a big-screen adaptation of the 1970s television series.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference">[37]</sup> Ice Cube will play the title character, originally portrayed by Gabe Kaplan and his film company, Cube Vision Productions, has sealed a deal with Dimension Films to bring the show to the big screen.

In October 2006, Xzibit, Lil Jon and WC from the Westside Connection honored Ice Cube at VH1&#8217;s Annual Hip Hop Honors, performing some classic Ice Cube tracks, and Ice Cube also performed &#8220;Why We Thugs&#8221; and &#8220;Go To Church&#8221; from his album _Laugh Now, Cry Later_, where the New York crowd were greeted with Cube&#8217;s vintage Cali sound. After launching that comeback album, Ice Cube toured across the world to promote it. The tour is known as &#8220;Straight Outta Compton Tour&#8221;, and accompanying him is his friend and fellow rapper WC from the Westside Connection. Some places he has recently performed include the Paradiso in Amsterdam and various venues in England. After touring the U.S. and Europe, he performed all around Australia, from Sydney&#8217;s Enmore Theatre to The Forum Arena in Melbourne, before heading to Japan.

Ice Cube collaborated with Tech N9ne on the song &#8220;Blackboy&#8221; that appears on Tech N9ne&#8217;s July 2008 album _Killer_. The eighth Ice Cube studio LP, titled _Raw Footage_, was released on August 19, 2008, and featured the singles Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It and Do Ya Thang.

Despite rumors of conflicts with other rappers in 2010, Ice Cube stated in an interview with DJ Whoo Kid on Sirius Shade 45 that he has &#8220;no beef.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference">[39]</sup>

Ice Cube&#8217;s ninth studio album _I Am the West_ was released on September 28, 2010. Ice Cube has stated this album has a different direction than any one of his other albums. He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as DJ Quik, Dr. Dre, E-A-Ski, and Sir Jinx, not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years. The album was released independently under his label Lench Mob. Ice Cube has stated that &#8220;being independent is beautiful because we can do things &#8216;out the box&#8217;.&#8221; He also signed an upcoming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, that record companies would usually frown at. &#8220;Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me.&#8221;

In November 2011, Ice Cube stated via Twitter that he was seven songs into the current album he&#8217;s recording. He also stated he &#8220;always got an album coming out&#8221; which suggests that he isn&#8217;t thinking of rap retirement to focus on acting in the near future.

A music video for the album&#8217;s first single of the same name was released on the day before the 2012 USA Election. Ice Cube explained the inspiration and reason for the song saying, &#8220;You know, this record is for the political heads. This to me is more a leak at the right time, in time, to drop it. We could have dropped a more catchier tune, but the time wouldn&#8217;t have been right. The time is right for &#8220;Everythang&#8217;s Corrupt,&#8221; so that&#8217;s what we wanted to do. We wanted to drop it at this point and time, and then come with a visual to highlight what we&#8217;re saying in the music.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference">[41]</sup>_Everythang&#8217;s Corrupt_ was released on iTunes in January 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference">[42]</sup> The second single &#8220;Crowded&#8221; was released to iTunes on March 29.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference">[43]</sup> Ice Cube confirmed on his Twitter account that the album will be released in the fall of 2013 and will also be released via Lench Mob Records.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference">[44]</sup> However, the album would be pushed back once again with no release date currently set.

When Ice Cube was asked in January 2005 on NPR by Fresh Air&#8217;s Terry Gross<sup id="cite_ref-NPR_65-0" class="reference">[65]</sup> whether he allowed his children to listen to his music, he responded: &#8220;What&#8217;s worked for me is instilling in my kids a level of self-respect&#8221;, and helping them to understand the content of not just music but the violence found on the evening news.
