I want to say from the outset that the Enneagram is one system among many powerful ones that  
can be used to help people understand their vocational talents, values and interests by  
understanding WHO THEY ARE INSIDE!

Hillary Clinton and Mahatma Gandhi are two famous Enneagram Ones but look how different they  
are based on other systems.

**So, what DO Hillary Clinton and Mahatma Gandhi have in common, both**  
**being Enneagram type Ones?**

All Ones seek to live in a “perfect” world and work diligently to improve themselves,  
everyone, and everything around them. They derive their sense of self from being reasonable,  
conscientious, self-controlled people. Whatever [healthy] Ones do they do it to the best of their  
ability with high standards of professionalism, competence, principle, honesty and integrity. They  
are hard working, self-disciplined and organized. They are passionate about making the world a  
better place for everyone and take their work seriously. They are willing to give blood, toil, tears  
and sweat for a cause they believe in. Doesn’t that sound like both Hillary Clinton and  
Mahatma Gandhi?  
Ones can have either a Nine wing or a Two wing. Mahatma Gandhi is a One with a  
Nine wing and Hillary Clinton is a One with a Two wing. If, after clicking on the previous  
links, you feel that you are more of a One with a strong Nine wing, look at what Enneagram type  
Nines need for career satisfaction as well. If you feel you are more of a One with a strong Two  
wing, look at what Enneagram type Twos need for career satisfaction as well.

Some average Ones can be perfectionistic workaholics who wonder why everyone doesn’t  
want to improve themselves and doesn’t work as hard as they do. Other average Ones have such  
impossibly high standards for themselves that they can’t even seem to get started. They easily  
feel overwhelmed and burdened by life. Everything they do is never good enough for them so  
they just procrastinate out of a fear of making mistakes or of failure. Average Ones are  
motivated by the need to live the right way, as they see it! They can be hypercritical of  
themselves and others. They can also be too painstaking, obsessive, compulsive, self-righteous,  
overly serious and controlling. Some average Ones can be too impatient to see progress. Any&nbsp;job where the motivation is to fix/correct things or others is especially appealing to average and  
unhealthy Ones.  
Healthy Ones are drawn to any job where the motivation is to inspire, uplift and encourage  
others to live according to their highest ideals and principles. Famous examples of healthy Ones  
are Al Gore, Margaret Thatcher, Tom Brokaw, John Bradshaw, Joanne Woodward, Peter  
Jennings, George Bernard Shaw, Colin Powell, William F. Buckley, Pope John Paul II,  
Stephen R. Covey and Nelson Mandela.  
Ones often seem like Solid Golds in the temperament system, even if they are actually Bold  
Oranges, True Blues (like Mahatma Gandhi), or Deep Greens (like Hillary Clinton). That’s  
because Ones try to abide by the laws of society and do the right thing, unless they feel the laws  
are unethical or unfair and then they will do everything in their power to change them, as a  
matter of principle (like Mahatma Gandhi)!
