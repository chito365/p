Involve partners who understand each other  
well in theory. They have interesting and  
satisfying conversations. They share a  
passionate, moth-to-flame love relationship  
but when they feel like they are half way to  
complete understanding, one of them usually  
does something&#8211;not deliberately&#8211;that ruins  
all established harmony putting the partners  
right back to where they started.  
Partners cannot stay upset with each other  
for long. After a stumble, they attempt to get  
close again which, unfortunately, leads to  
another stumble. Relations of Semi-Duality  
are also full of contrasts: from being happy to  
see partner again to sudden disappointment  
and bewilderment.
