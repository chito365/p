Brain wave color coding explanation:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Color &#8211; Wave Band &#8211; Hertz &#8211; Typical Indication (Overall behavior and energy level)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Black &#8211; Delta &#8211; 0.0-0.5 &#8211; Asleep

Blue &#8211; Delta &#8211; 1.0-3.0 &#8211; Resting

Green &#8211; Theta &#8211; 3.5-7.5 &#8211; Alert

Yellow &#8211; Alpha1 &#8211; 8.0-14.0 &#8211; Active

Orange &#8211; Alpha2/Beta &#8211; 14.5-18.0 &#8211; Energized

Red &#8211; Beta/Gamma &#8211; 18.5-40 &#8211; Excited

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Macro States:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Black: This state presents itself as solid black with near-zero amplitude and intermediate Frequency. It may easily occur when you meditate, watch television, or sleep deeply. Otherwise, this state is unusual.

&nbsp;

Blue (delta): This state occurs when we are awake and calm. It may easily occur when we busy ourselves with an activity for which we have creative expertise, whatever the expertise is. We might also enter this state when we are copacetic, open to whatever comes next.

&nbsp;

Green (Theta): This is a dissociated state, when we shut out bodily sensations and emotions, promoting an objective third-person experience. it may easily occur when we focus on problem solving, lose a game, don&#8217;t like someone or argue using reason.

&nbsp;

Yellow (Alpha): This is an associated state, when we admit and focus on bodily sensations and emotions, promoting a subjective, first-person experience. It may easily occur when we win a game, like someone, or listen to our favorite music with eyes closed.

&nbsp;

Orange: Not observed to date.

&nbsp;

Red (Beta): This state occurs when neocortex is hyper-stimulated. It may easily occur when we learn the rules of a promising new game ,attend a festival of lights and sounds, experience an &#8220;Ah-ha!&#8221; moment of insight, or see someone attractive. The brain may take time to &#8220;come down&#8221; from this excited state.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Asynchronous states:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Mixed (low) &#8220;Tennis Hop&#8221;: This state looks black but on closer inspection all regions are rapidly varying between color bands at 2-5Hz. This state may easily occur when we play videogames, or are alert but bored, or are waiting to respond to an uncertain outcome.

&nbsp;

Mixed (High) &#8220;Christmas tree&#8221;: All regions are wildly out of synch and each region keeps changing in frequency and varying between mid and high amplitudes. This mode occurs when we engage in transcontextual thinking.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Region descriptions:

&nbsp;

&#8220;Region Fp1: The Chief Judge skill-Set&#8221;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chief Judge: Quickly make decisions and select among options. Stay results-oriented and sharp. Screen out distractions and criticism. Look confident, happy, secure, and winning. Feel comfortable expediting situations. With overuse, may tend toward self-promotion and overly grand thinking.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This region sits just above our left eye, behind our forehead, in the left frontal lobe.

&nbsp;

It is active when we:

-Provide a reason.

-Decide between options.

-Detect an error.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It collects and integrates information from all other regions to make and explain decisions. People use this region when they say, &#8220;I think this because&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I pick that one&#8221;. It literally lights up just fractions of a second before we speak or act. We may verbalize our reason or decision, or we may keep it to ourselves. Either way, the results come rapidly and with confidence. This region can help us concoct reasons that sound plausible or actions that look doable. It also detects errors and deviations from the norm, signaling when something is not right.

&nbsp;

This region activates to help us ignore unwanted ideas that are negative or undesirable so that we stay happy and positive. When we hear criticism, take in violent or depressing content, or are exposed to a disruptive idea, this region may easily come into play, directing our attention elsewhere. In a study by Ginette Blackhart, this region lit up when people decided to skip an introspective task. The task asked them to explore how a sad story they just read applied to their own lives. Coversely, this region was less active for people who introspected. Thus, it seems that happiness comes at the price of willful ignorance!Statistically, more people use this region than any other. Those who under-use this region may be slow to make decisions, struggle to provide explanations, and/or have difficulty noticing errors or screening out negative input. Also, criticism or unpleasant ideas may easily move them to sadness, anger, or fear.

&nbsp;

Using this region may frustrate us sometimes. Using it feels confident and quick, but its actual performance may be poor&#8212;-a bad choice or illogical explanation&#8212;&#8211;particularly when relying on it to ignore unwanted information.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Region Fp2: The process Manager Skill-set&#8221;

&nbsp;

Navigate through a process, maybe step-by-step for tasks, or open-ended for creative brainstorming. Flex with reference points in mind. Notice progress of a task. Know when all ideas are in. Reflect on new data, delving into criticism for self awareness. With overuse, we may get de-energized. This region sits above your right eye, behind your forehead, in the right frontal lobe.

&nbsp;

It is active when you:

-Notice which step you are on in a task.

-Perceive that are done brainstorming.

-Consider a new or unpleasant idea.

&nbsp;

This region is like an ever-vigilant (but hands-off) facilitator or taskmaster, letting you know when to start, stop, or try again. It gets active when we are exposed to new information and helps us process that information in a productive way. People use this region when they say, &#8220;I&#8217;m done.&#8221; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of any more ideas.&#8221; It fires fractions of a second before we note where we are in a process. Broadly, this region helps us track whether we are at the beginning, middle or end of a task. For an open ended activity like brainstorming or re-living a memory, it suggests stopping points but is flexible. You are welcome to keep exploring. Unlike region Fp1, this region is not very verbal or directive, and it may quietly allow other regions of your brain to do their thing until it is time to move on.

&nbsp;

This region helps us explore and deal with information that is counter to what is typical or desirable. When we hear criticism, take in violent or depressing content, or otherwise receive disruptive data, we can use this region to delve into that information, considering its meaning and how it applies to us; simultaneously, it helps regulate our emotions so that we remain calm rather than getting angry. In one study, this region lit up for people who decided to explore how sad a story they read applied to their own lives. This suggests that sadness and depression may be a price we pay for introspective living.

&nbsp;

People who under-use this region may be impatient, preferring to focus on decision-making; and they may get side-tracked or erupt with bursts of hostility when to grapple with odd or unpleasant input.

&nbsp;

Using this region may frustrate us sometimes. While using it, we likely are ineloquent. Also, over-using this region may lead us astray as we delve into negatives or endlessly try a trask without making decisions.

&nbsp;

&#8220;Region F3: The Deductive Analyst Skill-Set&#8221;

&nbsp;

Follow a chain of reasoning. Backtrack to correct thinking due to logic errors. Read or listen with an objective mindset, working only from what is given. Wordsmith precisely to convey complex ideas in a technical way. With overuse, we may get legalistic and be too literal-minded.

&nbsp;

This region sits between your forehead and the top of your head, on your left side. It lies in the frontal lobe. Coincidentally, it&#8217;s the spot where right-handed people often scratch their head when trying to think!

&nbsp;

It is active when you:

-Make logical deductions.

-Backtrack or otherwise correct your thinking due to a reasoning error.

-Follow a chain of reasoning.

&nbsp;

We can use this region to make a series of logical deductions. For example, &#8220;If A equals B, and B equals C, then A equals C.&#8221; That said, this region is a lot more complex than a simple syllogism suggests. Using this region is like climbing around a tree of many branches. We start at the trunk, and each logical deduction carries us along a brach to a new spot on another branch, until we reach the last branch and hopefully deduce an accurate conclusion. When we use this region, the deductive process generates conclusions for us, whether we like them or not. Often we will need to backtrack to go in a more accurate direction. This region also sits by key brain sites for speaking, making it verbal, though we don&#8217;t need to speak loud to use it. Simply, use requires that we think in words or symbols (math, etc.) in a linear way and keep checking our logic at each step. In psychological experiments, people often say they are &#8220;logical&#8221; without fully appreciating what&#8217;s required. Using F3, we don&#8217;t just make-up reasons as we might using region Fp1. Truly, we deduce them.

&nbsp;

People who under-use this region may falter at deductive reasoning. A majority of people show less activity here than in other regions, suggesting that under-use is common. Moreover, regions like Fp1 and T3 can easily provide an illusion of sound thinking and accurate speech. Thus, a deficit may not show up in daily life unless the person works in a discipline that relies on deduction.

&nbsp;

Using this region may frustrate us sometimes. Accurate logical deduction takes work and patience for backtracking and self-correcting. Moreover, even when the reasoning is sound, a thought that is logical won&#8217;t necessarily match empirical evidence.
