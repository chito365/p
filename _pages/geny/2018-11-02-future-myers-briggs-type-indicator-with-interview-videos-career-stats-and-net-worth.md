    Future is one of the hottest American rappers of the recent times; he has everything going for him–the fan following, the music, the sound and the chartbusting albums. He has been dubbed by Billboard as the ‘Future of the Music’. And why not, for he officially became the first ever artist to knock out his own album (FUTURE) from the number 1 spot to replace it with yet another album of his (HNDRXX). With this, Future became the only musician in the Billboard’s history to ever debut two back-to-back #1 albums. Interestingly, it was his cousin who first introduced him to music and rapping. Little did Future know that his fate would be sealed and so would be his stage name for life. Since 2010, Future has released several mixtapes and albums, each of which have charted to the top spot. In 2012, he made the big leap with his debut album ‘Pluto’ that opened to positive reviews. He soon followed it up with equally successful second and third album. In 2015, Future hit it big internationally with his chartbursting album ‘DS2’ and super hit mixtape ‘What A Time To Be Alive’. With a universal influence and omnipresent chart dominance, Future surely seems to be the ‘Future’ of music.

                    Future was born as Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn on November 20, 1983 in Atlanta, Georgia in a family of street hustlers. He attended Columbia High School.

                    As a child, Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn was one of the members of the musical collective ‘The Dungeon Family’. It was there that he was nicknamed Future, a name that stayed with him for the rest of his life. It was his cousin, Rico Wade who encouraged him to hone his writing skills and make a career out of rapping.

                    From early 2010 to 2011, Future released a series of mixtapes titled ‘1000’, ‘Dirty Sprite’ ad ‘True Story’. In September 2011, he signed a major record deal with Epic Records fellow American rapper Rocko&#8217;s A1 Recordings.

                    After inking the deal with A1 Recordings, Future came up with his next mixtape ‘Streetz Calling’. Through the mixtape, he brought a new dimension to pop genre and nearly perfected it. Simultaneously, he also partnered with rapper Gucci Mane for their collective album ‘Free Bricks’. He even co-wrote the YC single ‘Racks’.

                    Though ‘Streetz Calling’ was deemed as the final mixtape before the release of Future’s debut album, in January 2012, he came up with yet another mixtape titled ‘Astronaut Status’. Though ‘Astronaut Status’ did not perform exceptionally well as his previous works, it nevertheless took Future’s rhythm and music well into the next year.

                    Future’s debut album ‘Pluto’ was released in April 2012. It included remixes of ‘Tony Montana’ featuring Drake and ‘Magic’ featuring T.I. ‘Magic’ went on to become Future’s first single to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart. ‘Pluto’ had inputs from Trae Tha Truth, R. Kelly and Snoop Dogg. Later in 2012, Future wrote, produced and was featured on ‘Loveeeeeee Song’ taken from Barbadian singer Rihanna&#8217;s seventh studio album ‘Unapologetic’.

                    Following the release of ‘FBG: The Movie’, Future announced the coming of his second studio album ‘Future Hendrix’. Much unlike his debut venture, ‘Future Hendrix’ was deemed to be more substantive musical affair featuring R&B music. Its lead single ‘Karate Chop’ featuring casino premiered on January 2013. In August, Future changed the title of his album to ‘Honest’. After much speculations, ‘Honest’ was released on April 2014. The album featured inputs from Kanye West, Rihanna, Ciara, Drake, Kelly Rowland, Jeremih, Diplo and André 3000 amongst many others.

                    On July 2015, Future came up with his next successful album ‘DS2’. He followed it up with a collaborative mixtape, with Canadian rapper, Drake, titled ‘What a Time to Be Alive’ later in the year. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, Billboard R&B Charts and Billboard Hot Rap Songs thereby making Future the first rapper in more than a decade to have two number one albums in a year. The mixtape alone sold over 334,000 copies in the U.S.

He immediately followed it up with his fourth studio album ‘EVOL’ that premiered on DJ Khaled&#8217;s debut episode of the Beats 1 radio show ‘We The Best’. With the release of his fourth album, Future became the fastest artist to have three number-one albums on the Billboard 200 since Glee soundtrack albums in 2010.

                    On February 2017, Future came up with his eponymous fifth studio album. While his fans were soaking in the ecstasy of his new album, Future showered them with yet another new album, his sixth titled ‘HNDRXX’. Both the albums went number one consecutively, thereby making Future the first artist to debut two albums at number one at the same time on the Billboard 200 and Canadian Albums Chart.

                    Though Future’s career started way back in 2010, his first major breakthrough came in, in 2015 when he came up with his album ‘DS2’ and a collaborative mixtape with Canadian rapper Drake titled ‘What a Time to Be Alive’. Both the albums were major hits and performed exceptionally well. The albums debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, Billboard R&B Charts and Billboard Hot Rap Songs thereby making Future the first rapper to have two number one albums in a year.
