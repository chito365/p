**_The_** **_Doer_**

**_&nbsp;_**

As an ESTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally and logically.

&nbsp;

ESTP&#8217;s are outgoing, straight-shooting types. Enthusiastic and excitable, ESTP’s are &#8220;doers&#8221; who live in the world of action. Blunt, straight-forward risk-takers, they are willing to plunge right into things and get their hands dirty. They live in the here-and-now, and place little importance on introspection or theory.

They look at the facts of a situation, quickly decide what should be done, execute the action, and move on to the next thing.

&nbsp;

ESTP’s have an uncanny ability to perceive people&#8217;s attitudes and motivations. They pick up on little cues which go completely unnoticed by most other types, such as facial expressions and stance. They&#8217;re typically a couple of steps ahead of the person they&#8217;re interacting with. ESTP’s use this ability to get what they want out of a situation. Rules and laws are seen as guidelines for behavior, rather than mandates. If the ESTP has decided that something needs to be done, then their &#8220;do it and get on with it&#8221; attitude takes precedence over the rules. However, the ESTP tends to have their own strong belief in what&#8217;s right and what&#8217;s wrong, and &nbsp;will doggedly stick to their principles. The Rules of the Establishment may hold little value to the ESTP, &nbsp;&nbsp;but their own integrity mandates that they will not under any circumstances do something which they feel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be wrong.

&nbsp;

ESTP’s have a strong flair for drama and style. They&#8217;re fast-moving, fast-talking people who have an appreciation for the finer things in life. They may be gamblers or spendthrifts. They&#8217;re usually very good at story telling and improvising. They typically make things up as they go along, rather than following a plan. They love to have fun, and are fun people to be around. They can sometimes be hurtful to others without being aware of it, as they generally do not know and may not care about the effect their words have on others. It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t care about people; it&#8217;s that their decision-making process does not involve taking people&#8217;s feelings into account. They make decisions based on facts and logic.

&nbsp;

ESTP&#8217;s least developed area is their intuitive side. They are impatient with theory, and see little use for it in their quest to &#8220;get things done&#8221;. An ESTP will occasionally have strong intuitions which are often way off- base, but sometimes very lucid and positive. The ESTP does not trust their instincts, and is suspicious of other people&#8217;s intuition as well.

&nbsp;

The ESTP often has trouble in school, especially higher education which moves into realms where theory is more important. The ESTP gets bored with classes in which they feel they gain no useful material which &nbsp;&nbsp;can be used to get things done. The ESTP may be brilliantly intelligent, but school will be a difficult chore for them.

&nbsp;

The ESTP needs to keep moving, and so does well in careers where he or she is not restricted or confined. ESTP’s make extremely good salespersons. They will become stifled and unhappy dealing with routine chores. ESTP’s have a natural abundance of energy and enthusiasm, which makes them natural entrepreneurs. They get very excited about things, and have the ability to motivate others to excitement and action. The can sell anyone on any idea. They are action-oriented, and make decisions quickly. All-in-all, they have extraordinary talents for getting things started. They are not usually so good at following &nbsp;&nbsp;through, and might leave those tasks to others. Mastering the art of following through is something which ESTP’s should pay special attention to.

&nbsp;

ESTP’s are practical, observant, fun-loving, spontaneous risk-takers with an excellent ability to quickly improvise an innovative solution to a problem. They&#8217;re enthusiastic and fun to be with, and are great

&nbsp;

motivators. If an ESTP recognizes their real talents and operates within those realms, they can accomplish truly exciting things.

<u>ESTP’s generally have the following traits:</u>

  * Action-oriented
  * Live in the present moment
  * Dislike abstract theory without practical application
  * Like to see immediate results for their efforts
  * Fast-paced and energetic
  * Flexible and adaptable
  * Resourceful
  * Seldom work from a plan &#8211; make things up as they go
  * Fun to be around
  * Highly observant
  * Excellent memory for details
  * Excellent people skills
  * Good-natured
  * Excellent ability to see an immediate problem and quickly devise a solution
  * Attracted to adventure and risk
  * May be flashy or showy
  * Like initiating things &#8211; not necessarily following them through to completion

&nbsp;

ESTP’s have some advantageous traits which are unique to their personality type. Their skills of &nbsp;observation make them extremely good at correctly analyzing and assessing other peoples&#8217; motives or perspectives. Their people skills allow them to use this knowledge to their advantage while interacting with people. For this reason, ESTP’s are excellent salespeople. They also have a special ability to react quickly and effectively to an immediate need, such as in an emergency or crisis situation. This is a valuable skill in many different professions, perhaps most notably in action-oriented professions, such as police work.

ESTP’s enjoy new experiences and dealing with people, and dislike being confined in structured or regimented environments. They also want to see an immediate result for their actions, and don&#8217;t like dealing with a lot of high-level theory where that won&#8217;t be the case. For these reasons, they should choose careers which involve a lot of interaction with people, and do not require performing a lot of routine, detailed tasks.

<u>ESTP Relationships</u>

**&nbsp;**

ESTP’s are gregarious and fun-loving individuals who want to make the most of every moment. They love action, and always seem to be doing something. This enthusiasm is carried over to their personal relationships, which they approach with the desire to make the most of their relationships on a daily basis. They tend to get bored easily, and may be prone to switching relationships frequently unless they find an outlet for their boredom elsewhere. They approach life on a day-by-day basis, so long-term commitments are not naturally comfortable for the ESTP. They may feel tremendously committed, but they want to take their commitments day by day.
