                                          Crowe returned to Australia at age 21, intending to apply to the National Institute of Dramatic Art. &#8220;I was working in a theatre show, and talked to a guy who was then the head of technical support at NIDA&#8221;, Crowe has recalled. &#8220;I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it&#8217;d be a waste of time. He said, &#8216;You already do the things you go there to learn, and you&#8217;ve been doing it for most of your life, so there&#8217;s nothing to teach you but bad habits.'&#8221;[20] From 1986 to 1988, he was given his first professional role by director Daniel Abineri, in a New Zealand production of <em>The Rocky Horror Show</em>.[4] He played the role of Eddie/Dr Scott.[4] He repeated this performance in a further Australian production of the show, which also toured New Zealand.[21] In 1987, Crowe spent six months busking when he could not find other work. In the 1988 Australian production of <em>Blood Brothers</em>, Crowe played the role of Mickey. He was also cast again by Daniel Abineri in the role of Johnny, in the stage musical <em>Bad Boy</em> <em>Johnny and the Prophets of Doom </em>in 1989.

Within the six-year stretch from 1997 to 2003, he also starred in two other best picture nominees, <em>L.A. C</em><em>onfidential</em> and <em><u>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the</u> <u>World</u></em>.

                                          In the 1980s, Crowe and friend Billy Dean Cochran formed a band, Roman Antix, which later evolved into the Australian rock band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts (abbreviated to TOFOG). Crowe performed lead vocals and guitar for the band, which formed in 1992. The band released <em>The Photograph Kills EP </em>in 1995, as well as three full-length records, <em>Gaslight </em>(1998), <em>Bastard Life or Clarity </em>(2001)

He began a collaboration with Alan Doyle of the Canadian band Great Big Sea, and with it a new band emerged: The Ordinary Fear of God which also involved some members of the previous TOFOG line-up. A new single, <em>Raewyn</em>, was released in April 2005 and an album entitled <em>My  Hand,  My  Heart  </em>which  was  released and  is  available for download on iTunes. The album includes a tribute song to actor Richard Harris, who became Crowe&#8217;s friend during the making of<em>Gladiator</em>.

The album has since charted at No. 72 on the Canadian Albums Chart.[35] On 26 September 2011, Crowe appeared on-stage at Rogers Arena in Vancouver in the middle of Keith Urban&#8217;s concert. He sang a cover of Folsom Prison Blues, before joining the rest of the band in a rendition of &#8220;The Joker&#8221;.[36] On 18 August 2012, Crowe appeared along with Doyle at the Harpa Concert Hall in Reykjavík, Iceland as part of the city&#8217;s Menningarnótt program.

The money went towards an $800,000 project to construct a swimming pool at the school. Crowe&#8217;s sympathies were sparked when a pupil drowned at the nearby Coffs Harbour beach in 2001, and he felt the pool would help students become better swimmers and improve their water safety.

The part cut was a poem in tribute to actor Richard Harris, and it was cut for copyright reasons. Crowe later apologised, saying &#8220;What I said to him may have been a little bit more passionate than now, in the cold light of day, I would have liked it to have been.&#8221;[64]

This procedure was under discussion as potentially violating Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Crowe later described the incident as &#8220;possibly the most shameful situation that I&#8217;ve ever gotten myself in&#8230;&#8221; .[69] Crowe pleaded guilty and was conditionally discharged. Before the trial, he settled a lawsuit filed by the concierge, Nestor Estrada.[70][71] Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but amounts in the six- figure range have been reported[.72]

                                          Crowe has been a supporter of the rugby league football team the South Sydney Rabbitohssince childhood. Since his rise to fame as an actor, he has continued appearing at home games, and supported the financially troubled club. Following the Super League war of the 1990s Crowe made an attempt to use his Hollywood connections to convince Ted Turner, rival of Super League&#8217;s Rupert Murdoch, to save the Rabbitohs before they were forced from the National Rugby League competition for two years.[77] In 1999 Crowe paid $42,000 at auction for the brass bell used to open the inaugural rugby league match in Australia in 1908 at a fund-raiser to assist Souths&#8217; legal battle for re-inclusion in the League.[78] In 2005, he made the Rabbitohs the first club team in Australia to be sponsored by a film, when he negotiated a deal to advertise his film <em>Cinderella</em> <em>Man </em>on their jerseys.[79] On 19 March 2006, the voting members of the South Sydney club voted (in a 75.8% majority) to allow Crowe and businessman Peter Holmes à Court to purchase 75% of the organisation, leaving 25% ownership with the members. It cost them A$3 million, and they received four of eight seats on the board of directors. A six-part television miniseries entitled <em>South Side Story </em>depicting the takeover aired in Australia in 2007.[80] On 5 November 2006, Crowe appeared on <em>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno </em>to announce that Firepower International was sponsoring the South Sydney Rabbitohs for $3 million over three years.[81] During a <em>Tonight Show with Jay Leno</em> appearance, Crowe showed viewers a Rabbitoh playing jersey with Firepower&#8217;s name emblazoned on[8it2.]

                                          Crowe helped to organise a rugby league game that took place at the University of North Florida, in Jacksonville, Florida, between the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the European Super League champions Leeds Rhinos on 26 January 2008 (Australia Day).[83] Crowe told ITV Local Yorkshire the game was not a marketing exercise.[84] Crowe wrote a letter of apology to a Sydney newspaper following the sacking of South Sydney&#8217;s coach Jason Taylor and one of their players David Fa&#8217;alogo after a drunken altercation

                                          Crowe&#8217;s influence helped to persuade noted player Greg Inglis to renege on his deal to join the Brisbane Broncos and sign for the Rabbitohs for 2011.[87] In 2010, the NRL was investigating Crowe&#8217;s business relationships with a number of media and entertainmen companies including Channel Nine, Channel Seven, ANZ Stadium, and V8 Supercars in relation to the South Sydney Rabbitohs&#8217; salary cap.[88]

                                          Crowe watches and plays cricket, and captained the &#8216;Australian&#8217; Team containing Steve Waugh against an English side in the &#8216;Hollywood Ashes&#8217; Cricket Match[.97] On 17 July 2009 Crowe took to the commentarybox for the British sports channel, Sky Sports, as the &#8216;third man&#8217; during the second Test of the 2009 Ashes series, between England and Australia.[98] He is friends with Lloyd Carr, the former coach of theUniversity of Michigan Wolverines American footballteam, and Carr used Crowe&#8217;s movie <em>Cinderella Man </em>to motivate his 2006 team following a 7–5 season the previous year. Upon hearing of this, Crowe called Carr and invited him to Australia to address his Rugby league team, the South Sydney Rabbitohs, which Carr did the following summer. In September 2007, after Carr came under fire following the Wolverines&#8217; 0–2 start, Crowe travelled to Ann Arbor, Michigan for the Wolverines&#8217; 15 September game against Notre Dame to show his support for Carr. He addressed the team before the game and watched from the sidelines as the Wolverines defeated the Irish 38–0. Crowe is also a fan of the National Football League. On 22 October 2007, Crowe appeared in the booth of a Monday night game between theIndianapolis Coltsand the Jacksonville Jaguars.[99]
