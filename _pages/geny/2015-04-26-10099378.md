<span style="font-family:Verdana;">Modeling approaches<br />Event-scheduling approach – as in Chaps. 1 and 2<br />Can uses general programming languages, or some simulation languages<br />During processing of an event, no simulated time passes<br />Process-interaction approach<br />Now used by most simulation software<br />Instead of identifying events, identify entities (a.k.a. processes) that are created, flow around or through the system, maybe leave<br />May have multiple realizations of an entity/process<br />May have different kinds of entities/processes<br />“Program” consists of a description of what happens to the different kinds of processes (including their entry and exit)<br />Usually expressed graphically, like a flowchart<br />During processing of an entity/process, simulated time usually passes</p>
