&#8220;For simplicity sake, I’m going to use the abbreviation LOA throughout the article when I’m speaking about the Secret or The Law of Attraction. Simply put, the LOA is said to be a universal law that states every person has the ability to attract things into their life with their thoughts and intentions. If someone is thinking and believing negative things all the time, they will attract them into their experience. If someone is thinking positive things all the time, they will attract that into their experience. In theory someone could also use the LOA to attract situations, experiences and material objects into their lives. Made most popular by books likeThe SecretandAsk & It Is Given, the LOA has grabbed the attention of many and for good reason, it can work very well and even when viewed scientifically, there is some interesting stuff to back it up. When you note the fact that everything is energy and that our thoughts and consciousness do impact and create reality, as quantum physics has shown, making the leap that we can attract what we want isn’t too difficult to assert.&#8221; &#8211; collective Evolution.
