<pre class="subHeader">Manager Bio

<strong>Jurgen Klopp got his chance to manage in the Premier League when he took over at Liverpool in October 2015.</strong>

The German arrived at Anfield after taking a short break from football following an impressive seven-year stay with Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga.

Klopp made over 300 appearances on the pitch, starting and finishing his professional career at FSV Mainz 05 in Germany’s second tier.

The Stuttgart-born manager then began coaching in 2001 at the club where he spent 11 years as a player.

Klopp oversaw promotion to the top-flight of German football in his third season in charge, subsequently ending a 41-year wait for Mainz’s first ever season in the Bundesliga.

Three seasons in Germany's top division followed, including qualification for the 2005/06 UEFA Europa League, before relegation to the 2.Bundesliga at the end of the 2006/07 campaign.

Klopp initially stayed at the club but departed Mainz at the end of the following season after the club were unable to gain promotion straight away. 

In the summer of 2008, Klopp was appointed as manager of Borussia Dortmund and was tasked with rebuilding a side that had finished 13th in the Bundesliga in 2007/08.

After two years under his reign Dortmund had finished sixth and then fifth before Klopp achieved back-to-back Bundesliga titles, including a German Cup win in the 2011/12 campaign.

Dortmund reached the UEFA Champions League final in 2013 under Klopp’s guidance, losing to fellow German side Bayern Munich at Wembley Stadium. Klopp left at the end of the 2014/15 season after seven years in charge.

On Thursday 8 October 2015, Liverpool announced Klopp as Brendan Rodgers’ replacement at Anfield, giving the German his first taste of management in English football.

The Reds finished eighth in the table come the end of the season, but Klopp guided his new side to the League Cup Final and the UEFA Europa League Final - losing both.

<strong>MBTI Personality: ENFP</strong>

Any thoughts about other ones? I've got my thoughts, but I'm not really sure of them, so I think I'll wait for other theories about further managers (and players).
