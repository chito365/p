Most people don’t have a personal mission statement which is why I am including some here  
based on each Enneagram type’s innate gifts, talents, interests and values. A personal mission  
statement is nothing more than a brief written statement of your overall purpose in life, your  
personal vision for who you want to be in and for the world. Helen Keller once said, “The most  
pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but has no vision.” I would use the word  
pitiable (as in evoking compassion) instead of pathetic but otherwise I agree with her. Without a  
“why” to live for that makes a contribution life quickly becomes empty and meaningless.

1. My mission is to help people overcome their self-doubt and indecision and learn to trust  
their own inner authority  
2. My mission is to inspire and empower people to courageously face their fears that stop  
them from having the life they really want  
3. My mission is to serve and protect my family and country  
4. My mission is to help struggling newlyweds stay together  
5. My mission is to provide stability and security for my family and loved ones  
6. My mission is to educate kids about the dangers of unsafe sex and drug & alcohol abuse  
7. My mission is to investigate alleged or suspected criminal violations of federal laws  
8. My mission is to bring more justice and fairness into the legal system  
9. My mission is to help raise people’s self-esteem and lower their mental anxiety  
10. My mission is to trust my divine intuition to take me where I want to go and stop second guessing
