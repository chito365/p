This important subject of _money_ and _financial success_ is not the “root of all evil” as many have quoted—nor is it the path to happiness. However, because the subject of money touches most of you in one way or another hundreds or even thousands of times in every day, it is a large factor in your vibration makeup and in your personal point of attraction. So when you are able to successfully control something that affects most of you all day, every day, you will have accomplished something rather significant. In other words, because such a high percentage of your thoughts in any given day reside around the topic of money or financial success, as soon as you are able to _deliberately_ guide your thoughts, not only is it certain that your financial success must improve, but the evidence of _that_ success will then prepare you for deliberate improvement in _every_ aspect of your life experience.

&nbsp;

If you are a student of _Deliberate Creation,_ if you want to consciously create your own reality, if you desire control of your own life experience, if you want to fulfill your reason for being, then your understanding of these prevalent topics—_money_ _and the <u>Law of Attraction</u>_—will serve you enormously well.
