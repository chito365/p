**Are you more like an Eight with a Seven wing or an Eight with a Nine wing?** 

Read below to find out.

## Type Eight with a Seven Wing (8w7)

**Positive:**  
• Powerful, Practical, Assertive  
• Action-oriented, Like to Lead  
• Quick-minded, Visionary,  
• Independent and Enterprising  
• Pragmatic, Hearty, Robust  
• Entrepreneurial, Ambitious  
• Sociable, Outgoing, Confident  
**Negative:**  
• Materialistic, Confrontational  
• Impulsive, Addictive, Hostile

**Type Eight with a Seven Wing:** Eights with a Seven wing (8w7s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Sevens than of Nines (the other wing), although both wings (7 and 9) can influence  
their personality. 8w7s tend to be more extroverted, energetic, enterprising and risk taking than  
8w9s. 8w7s are definitely one of the most independent and entrepreneurial subtypes of the  
Enneagram. They do not like working for someone but if they do they need a lot of freedom and  
leeway in their job or to be one of the top dogs calling the shots. They can be quite visionary and  
idealistic and are willing to work very hard to bring their dreams into reality. They are sociable,  
gregarious, self-confident and have a kind of cheerfully boisterous bravado about them. They can  
be extremely generous with close friends and family. 8w7s are charismatic, quick-minded and  
action-oriented. They are practical doers who want to make an impact on the world and easily  
rally support for their visionary hopes, dreams and plans. 8w7s enjoy challenging people to make  
something of themselves and they like using their powerful connections to create opportunities  
for people to do so.  
Negatively, 8w7s are one of the subtypes most prone to addiction (drug addict, alcoholic,  
compulsive gambler, sex addict, etc.) given their lust for life and their tendency towards gluttony  
and excess. 8w7s love to have a good time and while they can be extremely generous they can  
also be ruthlessly materialistic. 8w7s can be impatient, impulsive, competitive, and overly  
ambitious. They can also be workaholics. They want to put their big dreams and lofty goals into  
action ASAP! They are not above making empty promises or exaggerating the truth about the  
potential of a project they are spearheading to get the venture capital they need. 8w7s like  
attention and can have big egos. They can be quite self-centered, egotistical and narcissistic.  
They are generally not concerned with people’s reactions to them. They can be insensitive to  
others’ feelings and can’t stand self-pitying weakness in other people (or themselves). At worst,  
they can use people and not feel any remorse. They are also prone to emotionally overreact to  
perceived offenses against them (they are more likely to be led by their feelings and passions  
than 8w9s). Then they can be explosive, confrontational, belligerent or even violent.

You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Eight with a Nine wing also (see  
below). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions.  
See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference  
might be.

**Type Eight with a Nine Wing (8w9)**

**Positive:**  
• Quiet Strength/Self-confidence  
• Calm, Kind-hearted, Steady  
• Loving, more family-oriented than 8w7s (love kids/pets too)  
• Supportive, Patient, Modest  
• Friendly while sizing people up  
• Nurturing, Protective, Gentle  
**Negative:**  
• Stubborn, Quietly Dominating  
• Indifferent, Explosive Anger

**Type Eight with a Nine Wing:** Eights with a Nine wing (8w9s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Nines than of Sevens (the other wing), although both wings (9 and 7) can influence  
their personality. Because of the influence of the 9 wing 8w9s tend to be more mild-mannered,  
quietly strong, receptive and gentle than 8w7s. There is a calm, laid-back quality to them that  
belies the powerful, expansive energy lurking just underneath the surface. 8w9s are better able  
to pick up nonverbal cues and body language than 8w7s. Like 8w7s, 8w9s don’t like taking  
orders from anyone and prefer to be in a position of leadership (sometimes behind the scenes  
though) or running their own show. The presence of the 9 wing allows 8w9s to pursue their goals  
in a steadier, less impulsive, less wheeler-dealing way than 8w7s. They are also more  
unpretentious, patient and not as easily perturbed as 8w7s. 8w9s like their freedom but are  
more family and relationship-oriented than 8w7s. They enjoy spending time with their loved ones  
and are often drawn to the innocence and guilelessness of children and pets. They are also very  
nurturing toward and protective of their loved ones. They often make well-liked, competent  
leaders because of their receptivity to other peoples’ points of view as well as their ability to  
reassure, calm and support others.  
Negatively, 8w9s can have a dual nature. Eights are naturally assertive and Nines are naturally  
unassertive. This can lead 8w9s to be assertive in some areas of their life and less assertive in  
others. Usually 8w9s tend to be more assertive and aggressive at work because they are not as  
attached to them and more affectionate and loving at home. 8w9s can be incredibly stubborn,  
calming dominating, indifferent and impassive. Sometimes that can fall prey to muddled,  
confused thinking due to the 9 wing influence. At worst, they can bottle up their emotions until  
they finally lose it and explode violently, sometimes abusing those they love before they come to  
their senses.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Eight with a Seven wing also (see  
above). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions.  
See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference  
might be.
