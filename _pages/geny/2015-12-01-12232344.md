<div>
  Evaluating a UI Design
</div>

<div>
  Expert inspection methods
</div>

<div>
  Cognitive Walkthrough
</div>

<div>
  Heuristic Evaluation
</div>

<div>
  Benefits:
</div>

<div>
  Applicable early in the design life cycle –can be
</div>

<div>
  used with paper design, prototype or full system
</div>

<div>
  Based on simple methodologies –not expensive
</div>

<div>
  Notes: Evaluators should not be a member of design team
</div>

<div>
  For best results, 3-8 evaluators required
</div>

<div>
  Cognitive Walkthough
</div>

<div>
  •Begin with&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  •a detailed interaction design scenario including complete
</div>

<div>
  sequence of actions, and screen design, menu’s etc., and
</div>

<div>
  •a user profile
</div>

<div>
  •Evaluators “step through”the sequence of actions
</div>

<div>
  •At each step, analyze whether the user would be likely
</div>

<div>
  to perform the correct action, by asking 4 questions
</div>

<div>
  Cognitive Walkthough (cont.)
</div>

<div>
  Questions:
</div>

<div>
  1. Will user’s current goal match the effect of this action?
</div>

<div>
  (i.e., will the user know whatto do next?)
</div>

<div>
  1. Is the affordance for this action visible?
</div>

<div>
  2. Will users be able to identify this action with its
</div>

<div>
  desired effect? (can the user see howto do it?)
</div>

<div>
  3. After the action, will users understand the feedback they
</div>

<div>
  receive?
</div>

<div>
  Note how this is related to Norman’s “Gulf of Execution”and
</div>

<div>
  “Gulf of Evaluation”?
</div>

<div>
  User Interface Design Principles (“Heuristics”)
</div>

<div>
  Nielsen: Original 10 Usability Heuristics (1990)
</div>

<div>
  Simple and natural dialogue
</div>

<div>
  Speak the user’s language
</div>

<div>
  Minimize memory load
</div>

<div>
  Consistency
</div>

<div>
  Feedback
</div>

<div>
  Clearly marked exits
</div>

<div>
  Shortcuts
</div>

<div>
  Good error messages
</div>

<div>
  Prevent errors
</div>

<div>
  Help and documentation
</div>

<div>
  Previously, published guidelines had hundreds or thousands&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  of rules
</div>

<div>
  Nielsen: Revised 10 Usability Heuristics&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  (based on extensive empirical testing)
</div>

<div>
  *Visibility of system status
</div>

<div>
  (i.e. feedback)
</div>

<div>
  Match between system and the
</div>

<div>
  real world (speak the user’s&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  language)
</div>

<div>
  *User control and freedom&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  (undo, redo, clear exits)
</div>

<div>
  *Consistency
</div>

<div>
  *Error prevention
</div>

<div>
  Recognition not recall&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  (minimize memory load)
</div>

<div>
  *Flexibility and efficiency&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  (includes shortcuts, macros)
</div>

<div>
  Aesthetic and minimalist&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  design
</div>

<div>
  *Help users diagnose and&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  recover from errors
</div>

<div>
  Help and documentation
</div>

<div>
  *Also included in Shneiderman’s 8 golden rules
</div>

<div>
  User Interface Principles/Heuristics (cont.)
</div>

<div>
  Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules
</div>

<div>
  *Strive for consistency
</div>

<div>
  *Enable shortcuts for frequent
</div>

<div>
  users
</div>

<div>
  *Offer informative feedback
</div>

<div>
  Design dialogs to yield closure
</div>

<div>
  *Offer error prevention and
</div>

<div>
  simple error handling
</div>

<div>
  *Permit easy reversal of&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  actions
</div>

<div>
  *Support userlocus of control
</div>

<div>
  *Reduce memory load
</div>

<div>
  Guidelines for reducing errors by ensuring complete and correct&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  actions:
</div>

<div>
  Prefer menus and selection lists to commands and data entry
</div>

<div>
  Check entry fields for legal values
</div>

<div>
  Insert or signal begin-end of paired markers (such as&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  parentheses)
</div>

<div>
  Automate important sequences of user actions (macros)
</div>

<div>
  Ensure correct commands (completion, etc.) ??
</div>

<div>
  Q: What other heuristics and guidelines will help to prevent errors?
</div>

<div>
  User Interface Principles/Heuristics (cont.)
</div>

<div>
  Heuristic Evaluation
</div>

<div>
  Definition and goals:
</div>

<div>
  Systematic inspection of a UI design for usability
</div>

<div>
  Using a set of heuristics or principles
</div>

<div>
  Purpose is to identify usability problems
</div>

<div>
  General approach:
</div>

<div>
  Conducted by a small number of evaluators (how many?)
</div>

<div>
  Each evaluator inspects the interface independently
</div>

<div>
  An observer may be present, to take notes and answer
</div>

<div>
  questions about the interface or the application/task
</div>

<div>
  Result is a written report or observer’s notes
</div>

<div>
  (observer’s notes may be ready sooner)
</div>

<div>
  Output is a list of usability problemsexplained in terms
</div>

<div>
  of the guidelines that were violated
</div>

<div>
  Heuristic Evaluation (cont.)
</div>

<div>
  Procedures:
</div>

<div>
  Typically 1-2 hours
</div>

<div>
  Evaluator inspects UI elements and compares them with
</div>

<div>
  a list of principles/heuristics
</div>

<div>
  Go through interface at least twice:
</div>

<div>
  first, get acquainted with the system
</div>

<div>
  then, evaluate specific UI elements:
</div>

<div>
  a. information organization and general task flow
</div>

<div>
  b. mechanisms provided (or lack of them)
</div>

<div>
  c. visual characteristics
</div>

<div>
  Note the importance of evaluator expertise of 2 kinds:
</div>

<div>
  usability expertise and application expertise
</div>

<div>
  Heuristic Evaluation (cont.)
</div>

<div>
  Severity ratings:
</div>

<div>
  0 &#8211; this is not a usability problem
</div>

<div>
  1 &#8211; cosmetic problem &#8212; need not be fixed unless time permits
</div>

<div>
  2 &#8211; minor usability problem
</div>

<div>
  3 &#8211; major usability problem, should be given priority
</div>

<div>
  4 &#8211; usability catastrophe &#8212; imperative to fix before product
</div>

<div>
  can be released
</div>

<div>
  Depends on:
</div>

<div>
  Proportion of users who can be expected to experience the&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  problem
</div>

<div>
  Impact of the problem on the users who experience it
</div>

<div>
  Heuristic Evaluation (cont.)
</div>

<div>
  Contrast with user testing:
</div>

<div>
  in user testing, users not experts in UI design
</div>

<div>
  in heuristic evaluation, evaluators may not know much about
</div>

<div>
  the application domain and the tasks being performed
</div>

<div>
  user testing involves realistic tasks
</div>

<div>
  in user testing, hints and assistance are avoided
</div>

<div>
  in user testing, the observer does the analysis&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  heuristic evaluation can take place at an early stage using:
</div>

<div>
  paper mock-up designs
</div>

<div>
  unstable prototypes
</div>

<div>
  hints and advice replacing documentation and help
</div>

<div>
  Heuristic Evaluation (cont.)
</div>

<div>
  Generating fixes:
</div>

<div>
  Some fixes can be identified easily, such as the need for&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  new mechanisms, consistent appearance, or more feedback
</div>

<div>
  Some problems require major re-design (confusing menu&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  structure)
</div>

<div>
  Group Debriefing &#8211; Brainstorming with several evaluators +&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  designers
