**Are you more like a Six with a Five-wing or a Six with a Seven-wing? Read below to**  
**find out.**

## Type Six with a Five Wing (6w5)

**Positive:**  
• Intellectual, Idiosyncratic  
• More independent than 6w7s  
• Excellent practical problem solvers and technical experts  
• Champion the disadvantaged  
• Original, Quiet, Cautious  
• Ability to concentrate & focus  
**Negative:**  
• Aloof, Reclusive, Rebellious  
• Negative, Arrogant, Reactive

**Type Six with a Five Wing:** Sixes with a Five wing (6w5s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Fives than of Sevens (the other wing), although both wings (5 and 7) can influence  
their personality. 6w5s tend to be more independent, idiosyncratic and serious than 6w7s. They  
are less likely to go to others for reassurance or advice. They also have a better ability to focus  
and concentrate than 6w7s. 6w5s are often somewhat intellectual and like to develop technical  
expertise. They are great practical problem solvers, probing researchers and superb analysts.  
They also make good pundits and teachers since they are usually well-read and learned. Some  
6w5s are interested in history in general and their ancestry in particular. Phobic 6w5s are most  
attracted to fields of knowledge that are well-established and have clearly defined guidelines,  
rules and parameters such as engineering, medicine, law, mathematics, and the sciences.  
Counterphobic 6w5s tend to be more antiauthoritarian and unconventional than phobic 6w5s and  
may even have spiritual or metaphysical interests that are not so mainstream. 6w5s (especially  
the social subtype) have a strong identification with the underdog and sometimes get involved in  
political or community causes with a humanitarian ideal of championing the downtrodden or the  
disadvantaged.  
Negatively, 6w5s can become aloof, secretive and insecure loners. They can become too bookish  
and reclusive with focused but overly narrow interests. They can be intellectually arrogant,  
cynical or enigmatically cryptic. They can see the world as a dangerous place and become  
suspicious of other people’s motives. They will denounce any perceived threat to their security no  
matter how unwarranted it is. This can lead them to be passive/aggressive, argumentative,  
rebellious, reactive and/or hostile (especially counterphobic 6w5s). At worst they can become  
extremely paranoid, brood over injustices to them and become vengeful or self-destructive or  
both.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Six with a Seven wing also (see  
below). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions.  
See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference  
might be.

## Type Six with a Seven Wing (6w7)

**Positive:**  
• Outgoing, Charming, Sociable  
• Engaging and Lively yet Loyal  
• Playful yet serious about commitments and security  
• Faster Pace than 6w5s  
• Will make sacrifices for family  
• Cheerful, Personable, Curious  
**Negative:**  
• Materialistic, Impulsive, Manic  
• Overreactive, Ingratiating

**Type Six with a Seven Wing:** Sixes with a Seven wing (6w7s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Sevens than of Fives (the other wing), although both wings (7 and 5) can influence  
their personality. 6w7s tend to be more energetic, sociable, engaging, fun-loving and less serious  
than 6w5s. They like to kid around and have a greater desire to be liked also. 6w7s are amiable,  
warm and often charmingly funny. They can be humorously self-deprecating, making jokes about  
their own fears, anxieties and insecurities as a way to bond with others or subtly seek  
reassurance. While less serious than 6w5s they are no less committed, loyal and faithful to loved  
ones and friends. 6w7s are capable of making great sacrifices for the well-being and safety of  
their kith and kin. Some 6w7s are drawn to the performing arts, media and entertainment  
industries where they can make use of their charming interpersonal qualities as well as their selfdiscipline,  
industriousness and conscientiousness.  
Negatively, 6w7s can be overtly nervous, anxious and insecure. They can come to depend on  
friends and loved ones for reassurance and advice when they have to make important decisions.  
They can be overly ingratiating because they want to be accepted and liked. On the other hand,  
they can be highly opinionated and very vocal about their likes and dislikes. Some 6w7s can be  
materialistic and impossible to please. A 6w7 can have a tendency to send mixed messages to  
his/her partner. Negative 6w7s test their partner’s loyalty overtly and sometimes falsely accuse  
their partner of wrongdoing. When suspicious of their partner or whenever feeling threatened  
they can have a hair-trigger reaction of temper or moodiness. Procrastination and, paradoxically,  
impulsivity can both be big problems. 6w7s can procrastinate by feeling overwhelmed to start a  
project or task. They can be impulsive as a way to distract themselves and hopefully quench  
their anxiety. At worst, 6w7s can become completely manic, ungrounded, chaotic and subject to  
irrational fears, huge mood swings (from mania to depression and vice versa) and inferiority  
complexes. They may resort to drugs, drinking, overspending, overexercising, overeating or nonproductive  
hanging-out as a way to try calming their anxieties.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type Six with a Five wing also (see above).  
However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions. See if you  
can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference might be.
