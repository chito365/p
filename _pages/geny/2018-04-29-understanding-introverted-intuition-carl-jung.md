## **CARL&nbsp;JUNG on INTUITION:**

“Sensation tells you that there is something. Thinking, roughly speaking, tells you what it is. Feeling tells you whether it is agreeable or not, to be accepted or not, accepted or rejected. And intuition now there is a difficulty; you don&#8217;t know, ordinarily, how intuition works. So when a man has a hunch you can&#8217;t tell exactly how he got at that hunch or where that hunch comes from, it is something funny about intuition.

I will tell you a little story; I had two patients, the man was a sensation type and the woman an intuitive type – of course they felt attraction. And so, they took a little boat and went out onto the lake of Zürich and there were those birds that dive after fish, you know, and then after a certain time they come up again and you can&#8217;t tell where they come up. And so, they began to bet: who was the first to see the bird. Now, you would think that the one that observes reality very carefully – the sensation type – would of course win out. Not at all! The woman won the bet completely. She beat.. she was beating him on all points because by intuition she knew it before. Now – how is that possible? Well sometimes, you know, you can really find out how it works by finding the intermediate links. It is a perception by intermediate links and you only get the result of that whole chain of associations. Sometimes you succeed in finding out but more often you don&#8217;t.

So my definition is: intuition is a perception, by ways or means of the unconscious. That is as near as I can get. It is a very important function because when you live under primitive conditions a lot of unpredictable things are likely to happen and there you need your intuition because you cannot possibly tell by your perceptions, by your sense perceptions, what is going to happen.”

### **INTROVERTED&nbsp;INTUITION:**

**Interviewer&nbsp;asks:**

“For example, more specifically, what would be an example or difference between an intuitive extrovert and an intuitive introvert.”

**Carl&nbsp;Jung answers:**

“Well the&#8230; [smirks] you have chosen [chuckles] a somewhat difficult case, because you know one of the, one of the most difficult types is the intuitive introvert. The intuitive extrovert you find them all kinds of [can&#8217;t hear what he is saying] that is quite understandable; but the introvert, the introvert variety is more difficult because he has intuition as to the subjective factor, namely; the inner world. And of course that is now – very -difficult to understand because what he sees are most uncommon things and he doesn&#8217;t like to talk of them, if he&#8217;s not a fool, because he would spoil his own game by telling what he sees because people won&#8217;t understand it.

For instance once I had a patient, a young woman about twenty-seven or eight, and her first words were, when I had seated her&#8230; she said &#8216;you know doctor, I come to you, because I have a snake in my abdomen&#8217; and I said &#8216;What!?&#8217;; &#8216;Yes, a snake! A black snake curled up at the bottom of my abdomen&#8217;. And I must have made a rather bewildered face at her, she said &#8216;You know I don&#8217;t mean it literally but I should say it was a snake, it was a snake&#8217;. Now you see our further conversation a little later was that she said, it was about in the middle of our treatments that only lasted for ten consultations she had foretold me that &#8216;I come ten times and then it&#8217;s alright&#8217;, I said &#8216;how do you know?&#8217;, &#8216;Oh, I got a hunch&#8217; she said. And really about the fifth or sixth hour she said &#8216;Doctor I must tell you, the snake has risen, it is now about here [points to chest]&#8217;&#8230; Hunch.

And then, on the tenth day I said &#8216;Now is our last hour, do you feel cured?&#8217;, and she said – beaming – she said &#8216;You know, this morning it came up, and came out of my mouth and the head was golden.&#8217; and those were her last words.

Now be that same girl when it comes to reality, she came to me because she couldn&#8217;t hear the steps of her feet anymore because she walked on air, literally, she couldn&#8217;t hear it and that frightened her&nbsp;And then she came to me. I asked her for her &nbsp;address..It is&#8230;I never had heard of it. And uh..ya know..Of course, I never have heard of such place. [can&#8217;t understand what he says next] &#8230;very nice place&#8230;

A person cannot possibly speak of her experiences, because everyone would think she is absolutely crazy. I myself was quite shocked and I though &#8216;For heaven&#8217;s sake, is this a case of schizophrenia?&#8217; because you don&#8217;t hear that kind of things; she assumed of course that an old man knows everything, he even understands such kinds of language.

So you see if, when he, the intuitive introvert&#8230; the, um&#8230; the introverted intuitive would speak what he – really perceives – then practically nobody would understand him, he would be misunderstood, so they learn to keep things to themselves. And you hardly ever hear them talking of these things – that is the greatest advantage. But it is an enormous advantage in another way; so to speak of experience of the&nbsp;guard in that [???]&nbsp;respect of human relations. For instance; they come into a room or in the presence of someone they don&#8217;t know and suddenly they have inner images, and those innerimages give them more&nbsp;complete information about the subculture of the partner. But in another case it can also happen that they come into the presence of somebody whom they don&#8217;t know at all and they know and important piece out of that person and are not aware of it and they tell the story. And then the pot is in the fire&nbsp;so you see the introverted intuitive is, has in a way a difficult life; although one of the most interesting lives. But it is difficult often to get into their trust.

It&#8217;s just a sort of a skeleton to which you have to add the flesh or say&#8230;it is a country mapped out by&#8230;ya know.. triangulation points. That doesn&#8217;t mean that the country consists of&nbsp;triangulation&nbsp;points. That is only in order to have an idea of the distances. And, so it is a means to an end. It only makes sense, such a scheme, when you deal with practical cases.

Well I told you about that case with that intuitive girl who suddenly came out with the statement that she had a black snake in her abdomen – well, now, that is a collective symbol. That is not an individual fantasy, it is a collective symbol.”
