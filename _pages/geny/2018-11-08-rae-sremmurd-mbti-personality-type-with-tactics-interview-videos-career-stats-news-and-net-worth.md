Aaquil Iben Shamon Brown (also known as Slim Jxmmi) and his little brother Khalif Malik Ibn Shaman Brown (also known as Swae Lee) were born in Inglewood, California,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">[3]</sup> on December 29, 1993 and June 7, 1995 respectively. They grew up with their mother, Bernadette Walker,<sup id="cite_ref-Daily_Journal_Article_4-0" class="reference">[4]</sup> and their brother, Michael, their father having abandoned his family a few years after the birth of his sons.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-0" class="reference">[5]</sup>

Their mother worked for the army and was regularly deployed in different states. The family moved several times, leaving California for Mississippi and Maryland and finally settling in the military post of Fort Hood in Texas.<sup id="cite_ref-Noisey_Article_6-0" class="reference">[6]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-1" class="reference">[5]</sup> The two brothers started practicing, dancing and writing music together at an early age.<sup id="cite_ref-ReverNation_Page_7-0" class="reference">[7]</sup> In Texas, around his 10th birthday, Khalif learned to produce music using Fruity Loops.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-2" class="reference">[5]</sup>

While the two boys were in middle school, the family left Texas and moved back to Mississippi to join Bernadette&#8217;s new companion, Floyd Sullivan,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference">[8]</sup> after she left the army.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-3" class="reference">[5]</sup> They settled in the city of Tupelo, Mississippi, in the notorious Ida Street housing projects,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference">[9]</sup> where their stepfather lived. The young couple had a son named Floyd Jr. Sullivan. To support the family and to keep the boys in school, their stepfather sold drugs.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-4" class="reference">[5]</sup>

The Brown brothers met Jemiah Middlebrooks in Tupelo while he was playing basketball at a local park.<sup id="cite_ref-OurStage_Page_10-0" class="reference">[10]</sup> They decided to found a hip hop band called &#8220;Dem Outta St8 Boyz&#8221; with him. Aaquil took the stage name &#8220;CaliBoy,&#8221; Khalif &#8220;Kid Krunk,&#8221; and Jemiah &#8220;Lil Pantz.&#8221; <sup id="cite_ref-OurStage_Page_10-1" class="reference">[10]</sup> They used money from their part-time jobs to buy equipment and to produce music at home.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference">[11]</sup> The two brothers were composing their own beats and the trio were rapping. Visibly inspired by Soulja Boy Tell&#8217;Em, the boys released songs and dance videos on social media.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference">[12]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference">[13]</sup> It was at the same time that the group first met, and then later became friends with Jermarcus Jackson, aka JJ (today known as Jay Sremm), a young disc jockey, who was studying at Tupelo High School with the two brothers. He since became the DJ of the group.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-5" class="reference">[5]</sup>

Shortly after, Bernadette Walker and her companion split up. Following the break-up, the two brothers started skipping school and working more seriously on music. They would return home at late hours, even when they had school the next morning.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference">[14]</sup> Their mother, fed up with their schedules, eventually kicked them out of her house, leaving them homeless. They began squatting in an abandoned house in the city with a friend of their stepfather&#8217;s. They took advantage of the opportunity and organized parties in their new home in order to spread their music.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-6" class="reference">[5]</sup>

At the beginning of 2010, the group released the single &#8220;Party Animal&#8221;,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference">[15]</sup> which gave them a local fame, allowing them to perform at these local festivals and to broadcast their tracks on local radios.<sup id="cite_ref-Noisey_Article_6-1" class="reference">[6]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-7" class="reference">[5]</sup> Thanks to their savings, the group took part in the auditions of the &#8220;Wild Out Wednesday&#8221; segment on BET&#8217;s show &#8220;106 & Park&#8221; in Memphis, Tennesseeand succeeded to qualify. They participated on the show of December 8 in New York City and performed &#8220;Party Animal&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference">[16]</sup> Later, the group met a young rapper, named Andre &#8220;King Dre&#8221; Harris (today known as BoBo Swae), while he was freestyling in the high school courtyard.<sup id="cite_ref-ReverNation_Page_7-1" class="reference">[7]</sup> Andre, originally from West Point, Mississippi, started collaborating with the trio.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference">[17]</sup>Months later, the group finally released their first project, distributed locally.<sup id="cite_ref-Party_Animals_CD_18-0" class="reference">[18]</sup>

In the middle of 2011, Lil Pantz left the group due to legal problems and was replaced by Andre.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-8" class="reference">[5]</sup> Aaquil and Khalif took the opportunity to change their stage names from &#8220;CaliBoy&#8221; and &#8220;King Krunk&#8221; to &#8220;Weirdo&#8221; and &#8220;Kid The Great,&#8221; respectively. <sup id="cite_ref-ReverNation_Page_7-2" class="reference">[7]</sup> In August 2011, the trio once again participated in &#8220;106 & Park&#8221; and performed an original song &#8220;My Diddy&#8221;.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference">[19]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference">[20]</sup>They finished second place overall in the competition, and arranged meetings with representatives from record labels Def Jam Recordings and Sony Music.<sup id="cite_ref-Daily_Journal_Article_4-1" class="reference">[4]</sup> However, they did not sign any record deals at that time.

Around this time, Jemarcus put the group in touch with producer Pierre &#8220;P-Nazty&#8221; Slaughter, a cousin of his who had grown up in Tupelo but moved to Atlanta to work with Mike Will Made-It&#8217;s record label, EarDrummers. P-Nazty appreciated the teenagers&#8217; music and decided to work with them. Thereby, the three rappers left Tupelo and spent a few months with P-Nazty and &#8211; other EarDrummers producer &#8211; Marquel &#8220;Marz&#8221; Middlebrooks in Georgia.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-9" class="reference">[5]</sup> They took the opportunity to perform in talent shows and recorded the track &#8220;I Dip&#8221;, produced by Marz, and which increased their popularity a little more.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference">[21]</sup> They released their second project &#8220;_Three Stooges Mixtape_&#8221; at the beginning of 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference">[22]</sup>

Unfortunately, due to financial problems, the boys had to return to their hometown, causing the group dissolution for a while. The brothers began working to save money; Aaquil worked at a metres factory, and Khalif worked at a fast food restaurant where he served burgers. They were working about 12 hours per day.<sup id="cite_ref-MySpace_Article_23-0" class="reference">[23]</sup> When Aaquil turned 21, he rented an apartment into which Khalif and Andre moved. They began recording music and organizing parties on weekends again. Despite this, the rappers had problems with the police due to noise complaints and with their landlord when they stopped mowing their lawn.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-10" class="reference">[5]</sup> Meanwhile, P-Nazty and Marz, aware of the potential and motivation of the trio, tried to convince the rappers to leave their work and to return to Atlanta to try again to succeed in music.<sup id="cite_ref-MySpace_Article_23-1" class="reference">[23]</sup> After that Aaquil resigned, anticipating that he wouldn&#8217;t pass a drug test, the trio decided to return to Atlanta thanks to Andre, who had a car.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-11" class="reference">[5]</sup>

Back in Georgia, the group worked a lot, performed in local shows, and got attention in the Atlanta indie hip hop scene.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference">[24]</sup> P-Nazty, introduced them to Mike Will Made-It, who decided to sign them on his indie label, Made-It Mafia. In the meantime, King Dre decided to leave the group due to familial reasons and moved to Florida to focus on his studies.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Fader_Article_5-12" class="reference">[5]</sup>The now-duo decided to change their stage names again. The group took as their new name &#8220;Rae Sremmurd&#8221;, derived from Mike Will&#8217;s production team &#8220;EarDrummers&#8221; by spelling both words backwards. Aaquil chose the name of &#8220;Slim Jimmy&#8221; (later stylized as &#8220;Slim Jxmmi&#8221;), and Khalif opted for first &#8220;iHipster Lee&#8221; then a few months later &#8220;Swae Lee.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-ThroSumMo_Party_25-0" class="reference">[25]</sup> When Mike Will Made-It finalized the creation of his major label &#8220;EarDrummers Entertainment&#8221; in partnership with Interscope Records, the two brothers became the first artists to sign.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference">[26]</sup>

At the end of 2015, _&#8220;SremmLife&#8221;_ had been nominated by numerous magazine as one of the best albums of the year. Complex (magazine) even ranked the album as the third best of the year.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference">[55]</sup> This decision will cause a feud between the duo and Hot 97 radio presenter Ebro Darden, who considered that the album should not appear in this list.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference">[56]</sup>

_SremmLife_ was finally certified platinum in June 2016, along with the three last singles of the album.<sup id="cite_ref-RIAA_42-2" class="reference">[42]</sup>
