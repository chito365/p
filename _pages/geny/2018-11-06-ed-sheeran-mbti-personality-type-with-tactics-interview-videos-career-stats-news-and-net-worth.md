## Quotes:

> But once you&#8217;ve made a song and you put it out there, you don&#8217;t own it anymore. The public own it. It&#8217;s their song. It might be their song that they wake up to, or their song they have a shower to, or their song that they drive home to or their song they cry to, scream to, have babies to, have weddings to &#8211; like, it isn&#8217;t your song anymore.

          Sheeran&#8217;s third album, <i>÷</i> (pronounced &#8220;divide&#8221;), was released in March 2017. The album debuted at number one in the UK, the US and other major markets. The first two singles from the album, &#8220;Shape of You&#8221; and &#8220;Castle on the Hill&#8221;, were released in January 2017 and broke records in a number of countries, including the UK, Australia and Germany, by debuting in the top two positions of the charts. He also became the first artist to have two songs debut in the US top 10 in the same week.

          Sheeran performed a gig in Bristol, which raised £40,000 for a charity that reaches out to street sex workers. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to show insight that these people are real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else,&#8221; Sheeran said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more popular charities that get a lot of attention. And with certain subjects like this they&#8217;re often washed over and people don&#8217;t necessarily give them the attention they deserve.&#8221; Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity&#8217;s Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the £40,000 fundraising mark.<sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference">[152]</sup>
