## Extraverted (E) or Introverted (I)

&nbsp;

**Extraversion** refers to the act or state of being energized by the world outside the self. Extraverts enjoy socializing and tend to be more enthusiastic, assertive, talkative, and animated. They enjoy time spent with more people and find it less rewarding to spend time alone.

&nbsp;

**Introversion**, on the contrary, is the state of being predominately concerned with one’s inner world. Introverts prefer self-reflection to social interactions. They also prefer to observe before participating in an activity. Introverts tend to more quiet, ‘peaceful’, and reserved. Note: Introverts _prefer_ individual activities over social ones—this is not to be mistaken with shy people who fear social situations (“Extraversion”).

## Sensing (S) or Intuition (N)

**Sensing** refers to processing data through the five senses. Sensing people focus on the present and prefer to “learn by doing” rather than thinking it through. They are concrete thinkers recognize details. They are more energized by the practical use of an object/idea rather than the theory behind it.

&nbsp;

**Intuition** refers to how people process data. Intuitive people are keener to the meaning and patterns behind information. Intuitive people are more focused on how the present would affect the future. They are readily able to grasp different possibilities and abstract concepts. They easily see the big picture rather than the details (Myers 57).

They tend to be open to new options and experiences. While working on a project, they enjoy the process more than the outcome (Myers 194).
