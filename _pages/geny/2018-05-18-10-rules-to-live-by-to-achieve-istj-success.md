  1. Feed Your Strengths! Do things that allow your excellent organizational and logical abilities to flourish. Explore the worlds of business management, accounting, and medicine.
  2. Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to overcome them. Especially, strive to use your judgment against your internal store of knowledge, rather than as a means of disregarding other people&#8217;s ideas.
  3. Talk Through Your Thoughts. You need to step through your vast amount of information in order to put things into perspective. Give yourself appropriate time to do this, and take advantage of discussing ideas with others. Some find that externalizing your thoughts is a valuable exercise, as is expressing your ideas clearly in writing.
  4. Take in Everything. Don&#8217;t dismiss ideas prematurely because you don&#8217;t respect the person generating the ideas, or because you think you already know it all. After all, everybody has something to offer, and nobody knows everything. As Steven Covey says, &#8220;Seek first to understand, and then to be understood.&#8221;
  5. Quench Your Desire to Control Others. Remember that most people do not want to be controlled. Again, turn your controlling tendencies inwardly rather than outwardly. You can only really control yourself.
  6. Be Aware of Others. Take time to notice where others are coming from. What is their personality type? How are they currently feeling?
  7. Be Accountable for Yourself. Don&#8217;t blame the problems in your life on other people. Look inwardly for solutions.
  8. Be Gentle in Your Expectations, and judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.

    Assume the Best. Don&#8217;t distress yourself and others by dwelling on the dark side of everything. Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is a light side to every dark side. Remember that positive situations are created by positive attitudes, and vice versa. Expect the best, and the best will come forward.

    There is Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself. Sometimes it&#8217;s necessary to take a risk to initiate change. Don&#8217;t be afraid to do so when that time comes. In most cases, the obstacles and burdens standing in the way of your goal are not really there&#8211;they just exist in your perspective. Change your perspective&#8211;change your life.
