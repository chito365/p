# **Careers for ENTP Personality Types**

Whether you&#8217;re a young adult trying to find your place in the world, or a not-so-young adult trying to find out if you&#8217;re moving along the right path, it&#8217;s important to understand yourself and the personality traits that will impact your likeliness to succeed or fail at various careers. It&#8217;s equally important to understand what is really important to you. When armed with an understanding of your strengths and weaknesses, and an awareness of what you truly value, you are in an excellent position to pick a career which you will find rewarding.

ENTPs generally have the following traits:

  * Project-oriented
  * Enjoy generating ideas and theories
  * Creative and ingenious
  * Bright and capable
  * Flexible and Diverse
  * Excellent communication skills
  * Enjoy debating issues with other people
  * Excellent people skills
  * Natural leaders, but do not like to control people
  * Resist being controlled by people
  * Lively and energetic; able to motivate others
  * Highly value knowledge and competence
  * Logical, rational thinkers
  * Able to grasp difficult concepts and theories
  * Enjoy solving difficult problems
  * Dislike confining schedules and environments
  * Dislike routine, detailed tasks

ENTPs are fortunate in that they have a wide range of capabilities. They are generally good at anything that has captured their interest. ENTPs are likely to be successful in many different careers. Since they have a lot of options open to them, ENTPs will do well to choose professions that allow them a lot of personal freedom where they can use their creativity to generate new ideas and solve problems. They will not be completely happy in positions that are regimented or confining.
