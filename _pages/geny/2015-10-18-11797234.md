  The advantages of direct manipulation interfaces include
</div>

<div>
  intuitiveness,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  simplicity,&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  flexibility.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  Novice users find this type of interface easier to learn than an equivalent command-based or menu-based interface.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  The interfaces are adaptable to the needs of different users through customizing functions (placement and grouping of icons, sizing of windows, reduction of clutter, etc.) that each user can access to make the interface match their own preferences.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  <div>
    In addition, direct manipulation interfaces allow system changes to be made transparent to the user.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    In command-based interfaces, when a command changes or the file reference changes, users must be made aware of the change in order to continue operating the interface effectively.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    In a direct manipulation interface, the changes are said to be transparent because the user need never learn the new command or file name â€” as long as the icon remains the same, users will still be able to perform the desired task.
