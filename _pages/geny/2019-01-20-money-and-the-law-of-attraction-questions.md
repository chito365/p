### <a name="_TOC_250072"></a>4.       I Can Deliberately Choose to Feel Better

** **

The reason that Esther was able to allow that fuller perspective of Abraham to flow through her, providing her with such a delicious experience, was because she had begun that day by looking for reasons to feel good. She looked for the first thing to feel good about while she was still lying in her bed, and that good-feeling thought attracted another and another and another and another and another, until by the time she reached the gate (which was approximately two hours later), by virtue of her _deliberate_ choice of thoughts, she had brought her vibrational frequency to a level that was close enough to matching that of her _Inner Being_ that her _Inner Being_ was able to easily interact with her.

&nbsp;

_Not only does the thought you are choosing right now attract the next thought and the next . . . and so on—it also provides the basis of your alignment with your <u>Inner Being. </u>As you consistently and deliberately think and speak more of what you <u>do </u>want and less of what you <u>do not </u>want, you will find yourself more often in alignment with the pure, positive essence of your own Source; and under those conditions, your life will be extremely pleasing to you._

_ _

_ _

### <a name="_TOC_250071"></a>5.      Could Illness Be Caused by Negative Emotion?

** **

Esther’s experience at the gate was dramatically enhanced by her vibrational alignment with her Source and therefore with absolute Well-Being. But it is also possible for you to experience the opposite of that enhanced experience if you are _out_ of alignment with Source and Well-Being. In other words, sickness or illness, or lack of Well-Being, occurs when you vibration ally disallow your alignment with Well-Being.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Whenever you experienced _negative emotion_ (_fear,_ _doubt, frustration, loneliness,_ and so on), that feeling of negative emotion was the result of your thinking a thought that did not vibrate at a frequency that was in harmony with your _Inner Being._ Through all of your life experiences— physical and Non-Physical—your _Inner Being,_ or the _Total You,_ has evolved to a place of _knowing._ And so, whenever you are consciously focused upon a thought that does not harmonize with that which you’re _Inner Being_ has come to know—the resultant feeling within you will be one of negative emotion.

&nbsp;

If you were to sit on your foot and cut off the circulation of the flow of blood, or if you were to put a tourniquet around your neck and restrict the flow of oxygen, you would feel immediate evidence of the restriction. And, in like manner, when you think thoughts that are not in harmony with the thoughts of your _Inner Being,_ the flow of _Life Force,_ or _Energy,_ that comes into your physical body is stiffed or restricted—and the result of that restriction is that you feel negative emotion. _When you allow that negative emotion to continue over a long period of time, you often experience deterioration of your physical body._

_ _

Remember, every subject is really two subjects: _what is wanted_ or _lack of what is wanted._ It is like picking up a stick with two ends: One end represents what you _do_ want; the other end represents what you _do not_ want. So the stick called “Physical Well-Being” has “wellness” on one end and “illness” on the other. However, people do not experience “illness” only because they are looking at the negative end of the “Physical Well-Being” stick, but because they have been looking at the “I know what I _don’t_ want” end of many, _many_ sticks.

&nbsp;

When _your_ chronic attention is upon things that you _do not_ want—while the chronic attention of your _Inner Being_ is upon the things that you _do_ want—over time, you cause a vibrational separation between you and your _Inner Being,_ and that is what all illness is: separation (caused by your choice of thoughts) between _you_ and your _Inner Being._

### <a name="_TOC_250070"></a>6.      Pivot from Feeling Bad to Feeling Good

** **

Everyone wants to feel good, but most people believe that everything around them needs to be pleasing to them _before_ they can feel good. In fact, most people feel the way they do in any moment in time because of something they are observing. If what they are observing pleases them, they feel good, but if what they are observing does not please them, they feel bad. Most people feel quite powerless about consistently feeling good because they believe that in order to feel good, the conditions around them must change, but they also believe that they do not have the power to change many of the conditions.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

However, once you understand that every subject really is two subjects—what is wanted and lack of it—you can learn to see more of the positive aspects of whatever you are giving your attention to. _That really is all that the <u>Process of Pivoting </u>is: deliberately looking for a more positive way—a better-feeling way—to approach whatever you are giving your attention to._

&nbsp;

When you are facing an unwanted condition and are therefore feeling bad, if you will deliberately say, “I know what I _do not_ want . . . what is it that I _do_ want?” the vibration of your Being, which is affected by your point of focus, will shift slightly, causing your point of attraction to shift, also. This is the way that you begin telling a different story about your life. Rather than saying, “I never have enough money,” you say instead, “I’m looking forward to having more money.” That is a very different story—a very different vibration and a very different feeling, which will, in time, bring you a very different result.

&nbsp;

_As_ _you_ _continue_ _to_ _ask yourself, from your ever-changing vantage point, “What is it that I <u>do</u> want?” eventually you will be standing in a very pleasing place—for you cannot continually ask yourself what it is that you <u>do </u>want without your point of attraction beginning to shift in that direction. . . . The process will be gradual, but your continued application of the process will yield wonderful results in only a few days._

_ _

_ _

### <a name="_TOC_250069"></a>7.      Am I in Harmony with My Desire?

** **

So the _Pivoting Process_ is simply: Whenever you recognize that you are feeling a negative emotion (it is really that you are feeling the lack of harmony with something that you want), the obvious thing for you to do is to stop and say, _I’m feeling negative emotion, which means I am not in harmony with something that I want. What do I want?_

_ _

Anytime that you are feeling negative emotion, you are in a very good position to identify what it is that you are, in that moment, wanting—because never are you clearer about what you _do want_ than when you are experiencing what you _do not want._ And so, stop, in that moment, and say: _Something is important here; otherwise, I would not be feeling this negative emotion. What is it that I want?_ And then simply turn your attention to what you do want. _. . . In the moment you turn your attention to what you want, the negative attraction will stop; and in the moment the negative attraction stops, the positive attraction will begin. And—in that moment—your feeling will change from not feeling good to feeling good. That is the <u>Process of Pivoting.</u>_

_ _

_ _

_ _

<ol start="25">
  <li>
    <strong><em> What </em></strong><strong>Do</strong> <strong>I Want, and <em>Why?</em></strong>
  </li>
</ol>

**_ _**

Perhaps the strongest resistance that people have to beginning to tell a different story about their own life is their belief that they should always speak “the truth” about where they are or that they should “tell it like it is.” But when you understand that the _Law of Attraction_ is responding to you

&nbsp;

while you are telling your story of “how it is”—and therefore is perpetuating more of whatever story you are telling—you may decide that it really is in your best interest to tell a different story, a story that more closely matches what you would _now_ like to live. When you acknowledge what you _do not_ want, and then ask yourself, “What is it that I _do_ want?” you begin a gradual shift into the telling of your new story and into a much-improved point of attraction.

&nbsp;

_It is always helpful to remember that you get the essence of what you think about—whether you want it or not—because the <u>Law of Attraction </u>is unerringly consistent. Therefore, you are never only telling the story of “how it is now.” You are also telling the story of the future experience that you are creating right now._

_ _

Sometimes people misunderstand what the _Process_ _of Pivoting_ is, as they incorrectly assume that _to pivot_ means to look at something _unwanted_ and try to convince them that it _is_ wanted. They think that we are asking them to look at something that they clearly believe is _wrong_ and to pronounce it _right,_ or that it is a way of kidding themselves into accepting some unwanted thing. But you are never in a position where you can _kid_ yourself into feeling better about something, because the way you feel is the way you feel, and the way you feel is always a result of the thought that you have chosen.

&nbsp;

It is really a wonderful thing that, through the process of living life and noticing the things around you that you _do not want,_ you are then able to come to clear conclusions about what you _do_ want. And when you care about how you feel, you can easily apply the _Process of Pivoting_ to direct your attention toward more of the _wanted_ aspects, and less of the _unwanted_ aspects, of life. And then, as the _Law of Attraction_ responds to your increasingly improved, better-feeling thoughts, you will notice your own life experience transforming to match more of those _wanted_ aspects, while the _unwanted_ aspects gradually fade out of your experience.

&nbsp;

_When_ _you deliberately apply the <u>Process of Pivoting, </u>which means you are deliberately choosing your own thoughts, which means you are deliberately choosing your vibrational point of attraction, you are also deliberately choosing how your life unfolds. <u>Pivoting </u>is the process of deliberately focusing your attention with the intent of directing your own life experience._

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250068"></a>26.  I Can Feel Better Right Now

** **

People often complain that it would be much easier for them to focus on something positive if it were already happening in their life experience. They accurately acknowledge that it is much easier to feel good about something when something good is already happening. We certainly do not disagree that it is easier to feel good while noticing things you believe are good. But if you believe that you only have the ability to focus upon what _is_ happening, and if what _is_ happening is not pleasing, then you could wait an entire lifetime because your attention to _unwanted_ things is preventing _wanted_ things from coming to you. You do not have to wait for a good thing to happen in order to feel good, for you have the ability to direct your thoughts toward improved things no matter what is currently present in your experience. And when you care about how you feel and you are willing to pivot and turn your attention toward better-feeling thoughts, you will quickly begin the positive, deliberate transformation of your life.

&nbsp;

_Things_ _that are coming into your experience are coming in response to your vibration. Your vibration is offered because of the thoughts you are thinking, and you can tell by the way you feel what kinds of thoughts you are thinking. Find good-feeling thoughts and good-feeling manifesto- tons must follow._

_ _

Many people say, “It would be so much easier for me to be happy if I were in a different place: if my relationship were better, if my mate were easier to live with, if my physical body didn’t hurt or if my body looked different, if my work was more fulfilling, if I only had more money. . . . If the conditions of my life were better, I would feel better, and then it would be easier for me to be thinking more positive thoughts.”

&nbsp;

Seeing pleasing things does feel good, and it is easier to feel good when a pleasing thing is there, obvious for you to see—but you cannot ask others around you to orchestrate only pleasing things for you to see. Expecting others to provide the perfect environment for you is not a good idea, for many reasons: (1) It is not their responsibility to feather your nest; (2) it is not possible for them to control conditions you have created around you; and (3) most important of all, you would be giving up your power to create your own experience.

&nbsp;

_Make_ _a decision to look for the best-feeling aspects of whatever you must give your attention to, and otherwise look only for good-feeling things to give your attention to—and your life will become one of increasingly good-feeling aspects._

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250067"></a>27.  Attention to Unwanted Attracts More Unwanted

** **

_For_ _every pleasing thing, there is an unpleasing counterpart, for within every particle of the Universe is that which is wanted as well as the lack of that which is wanted. When you focus upon an unwanted aspect of something in an effort to push it away from you, instead it only comes closer, because you get what you give your attention to whether it is something that you want or not._

_ _

You live in a Universe that is based on “inclusion.” In other words, there is no such thing as “exclusion” in this “inclusion-based” Universe. When you see something that you desire and you say yes to it that is the equivalent of saying, “Yes, this thing that I desire, please _come to me._” When you see something that you do not want and you shout no at it, that is the equivalent of saying, “_Come_ _to me,_ this thing that I do not want!”

&nbsp;

Within everything that surrounds you is _that which is wanted_ and _that which is unwanted._ It is up to you to focus upon what is wanted. See your environment as a buffet of many choices, and make more deliberate choices about what you think about. If you will try to make choices that feel good to you, as you make an effort to tell a different story about your life and the people and experiences that are in it, you will see your life begin to transform to match the essence of the details of the new-and-improved story you are now telling.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250066"></a>28.   Am I Focused upon the Wanted or the Unwanted?

** **

** **

Sometimes you believe that you are focused upon what you want when actually the opposite is true. Just because your words sound positive, or your lips are smiling while you say them, does not mean that you are vibrating on the positive end of the stick. It is only by being aware of the way you are _feeling_ while offering your words that you can be sure that you are, in fact, offering a vibration about what you _do_ want, rather than what you _do not_ want.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250065"></a>29.  Focus on the Solution, Not the Problem

** **

** **

In the midst of what the television weatherman was calling “a serious drought,” our friend Esther walked down one of the paths on their Texas Hill Country property, noticing the dryness of the grass and feeling real concern for the well-being of the beautiful trees and bushes that were all beginning to show signs of stress from the shortage of rain. She noticed that the birdbath was empty

&nbsp;

Even though she had fled it with water just a few hours earlier, and then she thought about the thirsty deer that had probably jumped the fence to drink the small amount of water that it held. And so, as she was pondering the direness of the situation, she stopped, looked upward, and—in a very positive voice, with very positive-sounding words—said, “Abraham, I want some rain.”

And we said immediately back to her, “Indeed, from this position of lack, you think you will get rain?”

“What am I doing wrong?” she asked.

And we asked, _“Why_ do you want the rain?”

And Esther answered, “I want it because it refreshes the earth. I want it because it gives all of the creatures in the bushes water so that they have enough to drink. I want it because it makes the grass green, and it feels good upon my skin, and it makes us all feel better.”

And we said, “Now, you are attracting rain.”

Our question “_Why_ do you want the rain?” helped Esther withdraw her attention from the _problem_ and turn her attention toward the _solution._ When you consider _why_ you want something, your vibration usually shifts or _pivots_ in the direction of your desire. Whenever you consider _how_ it will happen, or _when,_ or _who_ will bring it, your vibration usually then shifts back toward the problem.

You see, in the process of taking her attention from what was wrong—by our asking her _why_ she wanted the rain—she accomplished a _pivot._ She began thinking not only of _what_ she wanted, but _why_ she wanted it; and in the process, she began to feel better. That afternoon it rained, and that night the local weatherman reported “an unusual isolated thunderstorm in the Hill Country.”

Your thoughts are powerful, and you have much more control over your own experience than most of you realize.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250064"></a>30.  What I do want is to feel good

** **

We visited with the young father who was at his wits‘end because his son was wetting the bed every night. This father was not only frustrated about the physical disruption of finding wet bedding and clothing every morning but he was concerned about the emotional ramifications because it had been going on for such a long time, and frankly he was embarrassed by his son’s behavior. “He’s too big for this”, he complained to us.

We asked him, “When you come into the bedroom in the morning, what happens?”

“Well, as soon as I walk into his room I can tell by the odor that he’s wet the bed again”, he told us. “And how do you feel about that?”

“Helpless, angry, frustrated. This has been going on for a long time and I don’t know what to do about it”, he said.

&nbsp;

“What do you say to your son?”

“I tell him to get out of those wet clothes and get into the bathtub. I tell him, he’s too big for this and that we’ve talked about this before”.

We told this father that he was actually perpetuating bed wetting. We explained to him, when the way you feel is controlled by a condition, you can never influence a change in the condition. But when you’re able to control the way you feel within a condition, then you have the power to influence change in the condition.

For example, when you enter your son’s bedroom, and become aware that something that you do not want has happened, if you would stop for a moment to think about that thing that has happened that you do not want, asking yourself what it is that you do want, and then further enforcing that side of the pivotal equation by asking yourself _why_ you want it, not only would you immediately feel better, but you would soon begin to see the results of your positive influence.

“What _do_ you want?” we asked.

He said, “I want my little one to wake up happy and dry and proud of him and to not be embarrassed”. This father felt relief as he focused upon what he wanted, because in making that effort he found harmony with his desire.

We told him, “As you’re thinking those sorts of thoughts, then what will be oozing out of you will be harmony with what you do want rather than harmony with what you do not want. And you will be more positively influencing your son. Then words will come out of you such as, “Oh, this is all part of growing up. And all of us have been through this. And you’re growing up very fast. Now get out of those wet clothes and get into the bathtub””.

This young father called very soon after that and happily reported that the bed wetting had stopped.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250063"></a>31.  Whenever I’m feeling bad, I’m attracting unwanted

** **

While almost everyone is aware of how they feel in varying degrees, there are few who understand the important guidance that their feelings, or emotions, provide. In the most simple of terms, whenever you feel bad, you’re in the process of attracting something that will not please you. Without exception, the reason for negative emotion is because you’re focused upon something you do not want, or upon the lack or absence of something that you do want.

&nbsp;

Many regard negative emotion as something unwanted, but we prefer to see it as important guidance to help you understand the direction of your focus, therefore the direction of your vibration, therefore the direction of what you’re attracting. You could call it a ‘warning bell’

&nbsp;

Because it certainly does give you a signal that lets you know that it’s time to pivot. We prefer to call it a ‘guiding bell’.

&nbsp;

Your emotions are your guidance system to assist you in understanding what you are in the process of creating with every thought you think. Often people, who are beginning to understand the power of thought and the importance of focusing upon good feeling subjects, are embarrassed or even angry at themselves when they find themselves in the midst of negative emotion. But there is no reason to be angry at you for having a perfectly functioning guidance system.

&nbsp;

Whenever you become aware that you’re feeling negative emotion, begin by complimenting yourself for being aware of your guidance, and then gently try to improve the feeling by choosing thoughts that feel better. We would call this a very subtle process of pivoting, whereby you gently choose better-feeling thoughts.

&nbsp;

Whenever you feel negative emotion, you could say to yourself, “I’m feeling some negative emotion, which means I’m in the process of attracting something that I do not want. What is it that I do want?”

&nbsp;

Often just acknowledging that you want to feel good will help turn your thoughts in a better-feeling direction. But it is important to understand the distinction between wanting to feel good and not wanting to feel bad. Some people think that it’s just two different ways of saying the same thing, when actually those two statements are exact opposite with huge vibrational differences.

&nbsp;

If you can begin to orient your thoughts by steadily looking for things that cause you to feel good, you will begin to develop patterns of thoughts, or beliefs, that will help you create magnificent good feeling lives.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250062"></a>32.  My thoughts dovetail into stronger matching thoughts

** **

Whatever thought you’re focused upon, whether it’s a memory from your past, something that you’re observing in your present, or something you’re anticipating in your future, that thought is active within you right now, and it is attracting other thoughts and ideas that are similar. Not only do your thoughts attract other thoughts that are of a similar nature, but the longer you focus, the stronger the thoughts become and the more attraction power they amass.

&nbsp;

Our friend Jerry likens this to the ropes he once observed while watching a large ship being docked. It was to be tied with a rope that was very large, too big and bulky to be thrown across the expansive water. And so instead, a small ball of twine was tossed across the water to the dock. That twine had been spliced into a little bigger rope, which had been spliced into a little bigger rope, which had been spliced into a little bigger rope, until eventually the very large rope could easily be pulled across the expansive water, and the ship was then secured to the dock. This is similar to the way your thoughts dovetail one to another, with one connecting to another, connecting to another&#8230; and so on.

&nbsp;

Upon some subjects, because you’ve been pulling upon the negative rope longer, it’s very easy for you to get off on a negative tangent. In other words, it just takes a little negative utterance from someone, a memory of something or a suggestion that takes you into a negative tailspin right away. Your point of attraction predominantly occurs from the day to day things that you’re thinking about as you’re moving through your day. And you have the power to direct your thoughts positively or negatively.

&nbsp;

For example, you’re in a grocery store, and you notice that something that you regularly purchase has increased substantially in price, and you feel strong discomfort wash over you. You may very well think that you’re just feeling shock over the sudden spike in the price of this item, and that since you have no say in what the grocer charges for the items that you have no option other than to feel discomfort about it. However, we want to point out to you that your feeling of discomfort is not because of the grocer’s action of raising the price of the goods for sale, but instead it’s because of the direction of your own thoughts. Just like the analogy of the rope tied to the rope tied to the rope tied to the rope, your thoughts are tied to one another and travel quickly to heightened vibrational places. For example,

&nbsp;

“Wow, the price of this is much greater than it was just last week. This price jump seems unreasonable. There’s nothing reasonable about the greed in the market place. Things are getting way out of hand. I don’t know where it’s all headed. It doesn’t seem like we can go on like this. Our economy’s in trouble. I can’t afford these inflated prices. I’m having a hard time making ends meet. I can’t seem to earn it fast enough to keep up with the increase in the cost of living.”

&nbsp;

And of course, this negative train of thought could move in any directions: toward blame of the grocer, to the economy, to your government&#8230; But it usually always turns back to the way you feel that the situation will negatively impact you, because everything that you observe feels personal to

&nbsp;

You. And everything, in truth, _is_ personal to you, because you’re offering a vibration about it that is affecting what is now being attracted to you by your choice of thoughts.

&nbsp;

If you are aware of how you are feeling, and you understand that your emotions are indicating the direction of your thoughts, then you can more deliberately guide your thoughts. For example,

&nbsp;

“Wow, the price of this is much greater than it was last week. However, I’m not aware of the other things in my basket. They could be the same or maybe even a bit lower. I wasn’t really paying attention. This one just got my attention because it was so much greater. Prices do fluctuate. I always manage. Things are going up a bit, but it’s working out alright. It is quite an impressive system of distribution that makes this variety of goods so accessible to us.”

&nbsp;

Once you’ve decided that care about feeling good, you will find it easier to more consistently choose a better feeling direction in your thoughts. When a desire to feel good is effectively active within you, a consistent inspiration toward good-feeling thoughts will be present. And you’ll find it easier and easier to direct your thoughts in productive directions.

&nbsp;

Your thoughts contain enormous creative attractive power that you harness effectively only by consistently offering good-feeling thoughts. When your thoughts constantly move back and forth between wanted and unwanted, pros and cons, pluses and minuses, you lose the benefit of the momentum of your pure positive thought.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250061"></a>33.  Creating a book of positive aspects

** **

In the first year of Jerry and Esther’s work with us they were using small hotel meeting rooms in different cities. Always wanting to provide a comfortable place where people could gather to address their personal questions with us. There was a hotel in the city of Austin that always seemed to forget they were coming, even though Esther had made arrangements with the hotel, signed contracts, even called in the days just prior to the event to confirm. The hotel was always able to accommodate them, even though when they arrived no one seemed to be expecting them. But it was very uncomfortable for Jerry and Esther to be in the position of urging the hotel to hurry to get the room ready before their guests arrived. Finally Esther said, “I think we should find a new hotel”.

And we said, “That might be a good idea, but remember, you will take yourselves with you”. “What do you mean”, Esther asked a bit defensively.

We explained to her, “If you take action from your perspective of lack, the action is always counterproductive. In fact, it is likely that the new hotel will treat you just like the last one did”.

&nbsp;

Jerry and Esther laughed at our explanation, because they’d already moved from one hotel to another for the very same reason.

“But what should we do?” they asked.

We encouraged them to purchase a new notebook and right boldly across the front cover of it: **_My book of positive aspects_**. And on the first page of the book right: _positive aspects of this hotel in Austin_. And so, Esther began to write:

&nbsp;

It’s a beautiful facility. It’s immaculate. It’s very well situated, it’s close to the interstate, it’s easy to find. There are many different sized rooms to accommodate our increasing numbers. The hotel staff is friendly.

&nbsp;

And as Esther was making those entries, her feeling about the hotel changed from one of negative to one of positive. And in the moment that she began to feel better, her attraction from the hotel changed. She did not write, “_They’re_ _always ready and waiting for us”_, because that had not been her experience, and writing that would have evoked a feeling of contradiction, or a feeling of defense, or a feeling of justification from her. But by wanting to feel good, and by deliberately focusing her attention more upon the things about the hotel that did feel good, Esther’s point of attraction regarding the hotel shifted. And then something Esther found very interesting happened – the hotel never forgot they were coming again. Esther was amused to realize that the hotel had not been forgetting about their agreement because they were uncaring or disorganized; the staff was simply being influenced by her dominant thought about them. In short, they could not buck the current of Esther’s negative thought.

Esther enjoyed her _Book of positive aspects_ so much that she began writing pages on many subjects of her life. We encouraged her to not only write about the things in which she was seeking improved feelings, but to write about things she already felt mostly positive about, just to get in the habit of good-feeling thoughts and for the pleasure of good-feeling thoughts. It’s a nice way to live.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250060"></a>34.  The Law of Attraction adds power to thoughts

** **

Often when experiencing an unwanted situation, you feel a need to explain why it has happened in an attempt, perhaps, to justify why you’re in the situation. Whenever you’re defending, or justifying, or rationalizing, or blaming anything or anyone, you remain in a place of negative attraction. Every word you speak as you explain why something is not the way you want it to be continues the negative attraction, for you cannot be focused upon what you _do_ want while you’re explaining _why_ you’re experiencing something that you _do not_ want. You cannot be focused upon

&nbsp;

Negative aspects and positive aspects at the same time. Often in an attempt to determine where your trouble started, you only hold yourself in that negative attraction longer. “What’s the source of my trouble? What’s the reason that I am not where I want to be?”

&nbsp;

It’s natural that you want improvement in your experience, and therefore it’s logical that you’re solution oriented. But there is a big difference between seriously looking for a solution and justifying the need for a solution by emphasizing the problem.

&nbsp;

The realization that something is not as you want it to be is an important first step. But once you’ve identified that, the faster you’re able to turn your attention in the direction of a solution, the better, because a continuing exploration of the problem will prevent you from finding the solution. The problem is a different vibrational frequency than the solution.

&nbsp;

As you become aware of the value of the process of pivoting, and as you become adept at identifying what is not wanted, and then immediately turn your attention toward what _is_ wanted, you will realize that you’re surrounded primarily by wonderful things, for there is so much more that is going right in your world than wrong.

&nbsp;

Also, a daily utilization of the _Book of positive aspects_ will help you to become more positively oriented. It will assist you in gradually tipping the balance of your thoughts more in the direction of what you do want.

&nbsp;

The more that you focus your attention with the intention of finding increasingly better-feeling thoughts, the more you will realize that there is a very big difference between thinking about what you want and thinking about the absence of it.

&nbsp;

Whenever you’re feeling uncomfortable as you’re speaking or thinking about improving something you want, such as a better financial condition or an improved relationship or physical condition, you’re in that moment preventing yourself from finding the improvement.

&nbsp;

The process of pivoting and the process of the _Book of positive aspects_ are both offered to assist you in recognizing in the early subtle stages of your creation that you are pulling on the very tips of that negative ball of twine, so that you may right away release it and reach for the positive thread of thought instead.

&nbsp;

It is much easier to go from a thought of something that makes you feel a little better to an even better feeling thought to an even better feeling thought than to go directly to a wonderful feeling thought, because all thoughts, or vibrations, are affected, or managed, by Law of Attraction.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250059"></a>35.  I’ll begin my day with good feeling thoughts

** **

When you’re focused upon something that you really do not want, it is actually easier for you to remain focused upon that unwanted topic, even finding other evidence to support that thought, than it is to move to a more positive perspective, because thoughts that are like unto themselves are drawn. So, if you attempt to make a big jump from a truly negative unwanted topic immediately to a positive delightful topic of something that you do want, you will not be able to make the jump, for there’s too much vibrational disparity between the two thoughts.

&nbsp;

A determination to gently, generally and steadily lean more and more in the direction of wanted things is really the best way to approach your personal vibrational improvement.

&nbsp;

When you first awaken in the morning after a few hours of sleep, and therefore a vibrational detachment from unwanted things, you are in your most positive vibrational state. If you would begin your day, even before you get out of bed, by looking for a handful of positive aspects in your life, you will begin your day in a more positive vane, and the thoughts that the LOA will now provide as your springboard into each day will be much better feeling and beneficial. In other words, every morning you have an opportunity to establish another vibrational basis, a sort of set point, that sets the general tone of your thoughts for the rest of the day. And while it is possible that some events of your day may deviate from that starting place, in time you will see that you have established complete control of your thoughts, of your vibration, of your point of attraction, of your life.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250058"></a>36.  Sleep time is realignment of Energies time

** **

While you’re sleeping, or during the time that you’re not consciously focused through your physical body, the attraction to your physical body stops. Sleep is a time when your Inner-Being can realign your energies, and it is a time for refreshment and replenishment of your physical body.

&nbsp;

If, when you put yourself in your bed, you will say, “Tonight I will rest well. I know that all attraction to this body will stop, and when I awaken in the morning I will literally re-emerge back into my physical experience “, you will receive the greatest benefit from your time of sleep.

&nbsp;

Awakening in the morning is not so different from being born. It’s not so different form the day you first emerged into your physical body. So, as you awaken, open your eyes and say, “Today I will look for reasons to feel good. Nothing is more important than that I feel good. Nothing is more important than that I choose thoughts that attract other thoughts that attract other thoughts that raise my vibrational frequency to the place where I can resonate with the positive aspects of the Universe.”

&nbsp;

You see, your vibration is right where you last left it. So, if you lie in your bed worrying about a situation before you go to sleep, when you wake up you will pick up right where your thoughts or vibration left off the night before, and then your thoughts for the day will get off on that negative footing. And then the LOA will continue to serve up for you other thoughts that are like those thoughts. But if you will make an effort as you go to sleep to identify some of the positive aspects of your life, and then deliberately release your thoughts as you remember that during your slumber you’re going to detach and refresh, and then if when you awaken you will open your eyes and say, “Today I will look for reasons to feel good”, you will begin to gain control of your thoughts and life.

&nbsp;

Rather than worrying about the problems of the world, or thinking about things that you have to do today, just lie in your bed and look for the positive aspects of the moment: how wonderful this bed feels, how comforting the fabric feels, how good my body feels, how comfortable this pillow is, how refreshing the air is that I am breathing, how good it is to be alive. You will have begun to pull on that positive good feeling rope.

&nbsp;

The LOA is like a giant magnifying glass, amplifying whatever is. And so, as you awaken and look for some reasons, something very immediate to you, to feel good about, the LOA will then offer you another thought that feels like that, and then another, and then another, and that really is what we call getting out of bed on the right foot.

&nbsp;

With a little bit of effort and a desire to feel good you can redirect your thoughts to more and more pleasing scenarios, until you will change your habits of thought as well as your point of attraction. And the evidence of your improvement in thought will begin to show up right away.

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250057"></a>37.  An example of a positive aspects bedtime process

** **

Your action orientation in life causes you to believe that it takes hard work to make things happen. But as you learn to deliberately direct your thoughts, you will discover that there is tremendous leverage and power in thought. As you focus more consistently only in the direction of what you desire, rather than diluting the power of your thought by thinking of the wanted and then the unwanted, you will understand from your personal experience what we mean. Because of your action orientation you often try too hard and work too hard, and as a result of that most of you bring yourselves more to the attention of what is wrong, or more to the attention of what needs to be fixed, than you do to the attention of what you desire.

&nbsp;

Here is a good way to apply the process of positive aspects at bedtime:

Once you’re in your bed, try to recall some of the most pleasant things that happened during the day. Since many things have undoubtedly happened during this day, you may have to ponder for a little while, and you may remember some of the less than pleasant things that happened. But stick to your intention of finding something pleasing. And when you find it, ponder it. Prime your positive pomp by saying things such as,

&nbsp;

“The thing I liked about that was,” or “My favorite part of that was&#8230;”

&nbsp;

And then follow any positive thread that you find, thinking about the best parts of your day. And then, once you’re feeling the effect of your positive thoughts, focus on your dominant intention right now, which is getting a good night sleep and awakening refreshed in the morning. Say to yourself,

&nbsp;

“I am going to sleep now, and while I am sleeping, because my thoughts will be inactive, attraction will stop and my physical body will be completely refreshed at every level.”

&nbsp;

Turn your attention to the immediate things around you, like the comfort of your bed or the softness of your pillow – the Well-Being of your moment. And then softly set forth the intention,

&nbsp;

“I will sleep well, and I will awaken refreshed with another new good feeling positive point of attraction.”

&nbsp;

And then off to sleep you go.

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250056"></a>38.  An example of a positive aspects morning process

** **

As you awaken the next morning, you will be in that positive good feeling place and your first thoughts will be something like, “Ah, I’m awake! I’ve re-emerged back into the physical.” Lie there for a little while and bask in the comfort of your bed, and then offer a thought such as,

&nbsp;

“Today, no matter where I’m going and no matter what I’m doing, no matter who I’m doing it with, it is my dominant intent to look for things that feel good. When I feel good, I’m vibrating with my Higher Power. When I feel good, I’m in harmony with that which I consider to be good. When I feel good, I’m in the mode of attracting that which will please me once it gets here. And when I feel good, I feel good. It’s just good to feel good. If the only thing it ever brought you is the way you feel in the moment. Ah, but feeling good brings ever so much more beyond that.”

&nbsp;

We would lie in the bed for 2 or 3 minutes. That is enough. And we would look for positive aspects of our surroundings. And then, as we move into the day, we would begin to acknowledge more positive aspects, looking for more reasons to feel good, no matter what the object of our attention is. In the first moment of any negative emotion, which will very likely occur, even though you’ve begun your day looking for reasons to feel good, because there is upon some subjects some negative momentum already in motion, so don’t worry about it, but upon the first inclination of any negative emotion, we would stop and say,

&nbsp;

“I want to feel good. I’m feeling some negative emotion, which means that I’m focusing upon something that I do not want. Now, what is it that I want?”

&nbsp;

And then we would turn our attention immediately to that which we want. Staying focused upon the new thought or the positive thought long enough that we could feel the positive energy again beginning to flow through our body.

&nbsp;

As you move through your day, look for more reasons to laugh and more reasons to have fun. When you want to feel good and you do not take things so seriously, and when you are not taking things so seriously, you’re not as likely to notice the lack of things wanted, and when you’re not focused upon the lack of what you desire, you just feel better. And when you feel better, you attract more of what you do want. and your life just gets better and better and better. And then that night as you lie in your bed, you’ll have many wonderful things to ponder as you drift off into your restful refreshing sleep. And then you’ll awaken into an even better feeling new day tomorrow.

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250055"></a>39.  I know how I want to feel

** **

Sometimes, when you’re in the midst of an uncomfortable situation, you struggle to find any positive aspects within it. Some things are intolerable. Some things are so big and so bad, that it does not seem possible for you to find anything positive about it. But that is because you’re attempting to take too large of a jump from the awfulness of what you’re focused upon to the solution that you desire. In other words, if you want to find an action solution right now that will fix this, but you find yourself in a situation where no action that you can take seems appropriate, always remember that while there may not be a positive aspect to your action in this moment, and while you may not be able to figure out what to do that would make you feel better, you always do know how you want to feel. It’s a bit like someone saying, “I’ve just jumped out of an airplane and I have no parachute. What shout I do now?”

&nbsp;

There are situations where, given the current circumstances, there is no action or thought that at this point will make a significant enough difference to change the outcome that’s barreling in upon you. And in the same way that sometimes you cannot find any action that will fix things, there’s no thought that will immediately change it either. But if you understand the power of your thought, and the incredible leverage that consistently good feeling thoughts provide, and you begin deliberately choosing your thoughts by utilizing the guidance that your feelings or emotions are indicating to you, you can easily transform your life into predominantly good feeling experiences by focusing upon the improved feeling.

&nbsp;

If you’re able to find even the smallest feeling of relief in a deliberately chosen thought, your gentle path toward your solution will begin. What to do in certain situations may not by clear to you, and you may at times not even be able to identify what it is that you want to have, but there’s never a time that you are unable to identify to some extent how you want to feel. In other words, you know that you would rather feel happy than sad, you know you’d rather be refreshed than tired, or invigorated rather than enervated. You know that you would rather feel productive than unproductive. You know that you would rather feel free than confined, and growing rather than stagnant.

&nbsp;

There is not enough action available to compensate for misaligned thought. But when you begin to gain control of the way you feel, by more deliberately choosing the direction of your thought, you will discover the powerful leverage in thought. If you will bring yourself to a more deliberate

&nbsp;

Control of your own thought, you will bring yourself to a more deliberate control of your own life experience.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250054"></a>40.  Nothing is more important than feeling good

** **

Becoming more deliberate about the things you think is not a difficult thing. You’re often particular about what you eat, or the vehicle you drive, or the clothes you wear, and being a deliberate thinker does not require much more deliberate discrimination than that. But learning to deliberately direct your thoughts toward the aspect of the subject that feels best to you will have a much greater impact on the improvement of your life than the choosing of a meal or of a vehicle or of clothing.

&nbsp;

Once you read these words and feel your own personal resonance with their meaning and power, you’ll never again feel negative emotion without realizing that you’re receiving important guidance to assist you in guiding your thoughts in a more productive and beneficial direction. In other words, you will never again feel negative emotion and not understand that it means you’re in the process of attracting something unwanted.

&nbsp;

A significant thing is happening with you as you’re coming into conscious awareness of your emotions and the guidance that they provide. Because even in your ignorance of what negative emotion meant, you were still negatively attracting. And so, understanding your emotion now gives you control of your life experience.

&nbsp;

When you’re feeling less than good, if you’ll stop and say, “Nothing is more important than that I feel good. I want to find a reason now to feel good”, you will find an improved thought, which will lead to another and another. And as you develop the habit of looking for good feeling thoughts, the circumstances that surround you must improve, the LOA demands it.

&nbsp;

When you feel good, you experience a sensation of doors opening as the Universe is cooperating with you. And when you feel bad, it feels as if doors are closing, and the cooperation stops. Anytime you feel negative emotion, you’re in the mode of resisting something that you want, and that resistance takes its toll on you. It takes its toll on your physical body, and it takes its toll on the wonderful things that you are allowing to come into your experience.

&nbsp;

Through your process of living life and noticing things wanted and unwanted, you’ve created a sort of vibrational escrow, which in a sense holds for you those wanted things you’ve identified, until you become a close enough vibrational match to them that you allow yourself a fully manifested

&nbsp;

Receiving of them. But until you find a way to feel good about them, even though they have not yet manifested in your experience, it may seem to you that they’re on the outside of a door that you cannot open. However, as you begin to look for more positive aspects regarding the things that occupy your thoughts, and as you deliberately choose the more positive end of the stick of possibilities, regarding the subjects that dominate your thought processes, that door will open and everything that you desire will flow easily into your experience.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250053"></a>41.   It gets better the better it gets

** **

When you deliberately seek positive aspects of whatever you are giving your attention to, you, in a sense, tune your vibrational tuner to more positive aspects of everything. And, of course, you could tune yourself negatively as well.

&nbsp;

Many people struggle in an attitude of self-criticism as a result of negative comparison that has been directed to them from parents or teachers or peers, and there’s nothing more detrimental to your ability to positively attract than a negative attitude toward yourself. So, sometimes by choosing a subject about which you’ve practiced fewer negative thoughts, you can tune yourself to a better feeling frequency, and then from that better feeling place, as you redirect your thoughts toward yourself, you will find more positive aspects about yourself than usual. Once you find more positive aspects of the world that surrounds you, you will begin to find more positive aspects about yourself. And when that happens, finding more positive aspects about your world will be easier still. When you find things about yourself that you do not like, you will find more of those things in others. You say, “The worse it gets the worse it gets”. But as you are deliberately looking for positive aspects in yourself or in others, you will find more of those things: &#8220;The better it gets, the better it gets&#8221;.

&nbsp;

We cannot overemphasize the value in looking for positive aspects and focusing upon more of things wanted, because everything that comes to you is dependent upon that very simple premise: you get more and more of what you are thinking about—whether you want it or not.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250052"></a>42.  My Universe is positively and negatively balanced

** **

So, you are the creator of your experience. Or you could say that you’re the attractor of your experience. Creating is not about identifying something wanted and then going after it and capturing it. Creating is about focusing upon the subject of desire, tuning your thoughts more

&nbsp;

Precisely to the aspects of the subject that you would like to experience, and therefore allowing the LOA to bring it to you. Whether you’re remembering something from the past, imagining something about the future, or observing something from your now, you’re offering thought vibrations that the LOA is responding to. You may refer to your thoughts as desires or beliefs (a belief is only a thought that you keep thinking), but whatever you’re giving your attention to is establishing your point of attraction.

&nbsp;

Because every subject is actually two subjects – what is wanted and the lack of what is wanted – it’s possible to believe that you’re positively focused, when in fact you’re negatively focused. A person may say, “I want more money”, but what they’re actually focused upon is the fact that they don’t have as much money as they need. Most people talk most often about their desire to be healthy when they’re feeling sick. In other words, their attention to what they do not want is what is prompting their remarks about what they do want. But in the majority of cases, even though they may be speaking words that seem to indicate that they’re focused upon their desire, they are not.

&nbsp;

It’s only by consciously recognizing how you’re feeling while you’re speaking that you really know if you’re positively or negatively attracting. And while you may not see immediate evidence of what you’re in the process of attracting, whatever you’re thinking about is amassing matching thoughts and vibrations and energies. And eventually the evidence of your attraction will be obvious.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250051"></a>43.  My Universe responds to my attention to&#8230;

** **

Most people believe, or would like to believe, that everything in the Universe responds to their words in the same way that other people around them can sometimes be trained to behave. When you tell someone, “Yes, come to me”, you expect them to come. When you say, “No, go away from me”, you expect them to go. But you live in an attraction based Universe, an inclusion based Universe, which simply means, there’s no such thing as “No”. When you give your attention to something wanted and you say, “Yes, come to me”, you include it in your vibration, and the LOA begins the process of bringing it. But when you look at something unwanted and you say, “No, I do not want you. Go away!” the Universe brings that also. Your attention to it, and therefore your vibrational alignment with it is what’s causing the response, not your words. And so, as you say, “Perfect health, I seek you, I want you. I bask in the idea of perfect health”, you’re attracting health. But as you say, “Sickness, I do not want you”, you’re attracting sickness. As you say, “No, no, no!”, it’s coming closer, because the more you struggle against something that you do not want, the more engulfed in it you become.

&nbsp;

People often believe that once they find their perfect mate or achieve their perfect body weight, or accumulate enough money, then once and for all they will find the happiness that they seek. But nowhere is there a little corner of something where only positive aspects exist. The perfect balance of the Universe says that positive and negative, wanted and unwanted exists in all particles of the Universe. When you as the creator, the chooser, the definer, the decider, when you look for positive aspects that become what you live in all aspects of your life. You don’t have to wait around for that perfect thing to show itself to you so that you can then have a positive response to it, instead you can positively train your thoughts and vibrations. And then you will become the attractor of it, or the creator of it.

&nbsp;

We would encourage you to begin each day with the statement: “Today, no matter where I go, no matter what I’m doing, and no matter who I’m doing it with, it is my dominant intent to look for what I want to see.”

&nbsp;

Remember, when you awaken in the morning, you are reborn. While you have slumbered, all attraction has stopped. That sequestering away for a few hours of sleep, where your consciousness is no longer attracting, gives you a refreshing new beginning. And so, unless you wake up in the morning and begin regurgitating what troubled you the day before, it will not trouble you in your new day, in your new birth, in your new beginning.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250050"></a>44.  Decisions to feel good attract good feelings

** **

A woman said to us, when she found out that she was going to be attending some holiday parties, she said, “As soon as I heard that I was going, I started thinking, “Oh, Mary is going to be there. She’s going to look so gorgeous””. She realized that just the idea of the party was causing her to compare herself to other people. And she said to us, “I want to stop doing that. I want to feel good about me, and just enjoy the parties no matter who is there”. She asked us if we could help her with the process of pivoting and positive aspects. She knew she was feeling self-conscious and didn’t know what to do about it. She said, “I don’t even want to go to the parties”.

We said to her, “While you’re feeling of self-consciousness is amplified, as you think about going to these parties, it’s not Mary who is the reason for your discomfort”.

&nbsp;

It often feels very complicated to sort out your relationships with other people. Sometimes you even try to trace those feelings back to your childhood. But there really is no point in doing that. You have the ability from right where you stand right now to find positive or negative aspects, to think of wanted or unwanted. And whether you begin the process now or several days before you go to

&nbsp;

The party, or whether you wait until you’re at the party, your work is still the same: <u>you must look</u> for <u>things that feel good when you focus upon them.</u>

&nbsp;

Because you have more control over what’s activated in your own mind, it is usually much easier to find the positive aspects of a situation before you’re standing right in the middle of it. So, if you do imagine the situation as you want it to be, and you take the time to practice your positive response to the upcoming situation, then when you’re at the party, you will witness the control that you set into motion days before, before you were at the party.

&nbsp;

You cannot feel good and bad at the same time. You can’t focus upon wanted and unwanted at the same time. So, if you’ve trained your thoughts to what you consider to be good or wanted before you arrive at the party, the LOA will deliver to you things that feel good and are wanted. It really is as simple as that.

&nbsp;

We said to our friend, if you want to feel different at these upcoming parties than you’ve felt at the parties in previous years, you have to begin telling a different story. The story you’ve been telling goes something like:

&nbsp;

“I’m only invited to these parties because of my relationship with my mate. It really is not important to anyone that I am there. I’m not really a part of his work environment, and I don’t really understand most of the things that they are interested in. I’m like an outsider. Mary doesn’t feel like an outsider like I do. Her confidence is obvious in the way she dresses and carries herself. I always feel less attractive and less smart, less everything when I’m near Mary. I hate feeling like this. I wish I didn’t have to go.”

&nbsp;

We told our friend, here’s an example of a better feeling story:

&nbsp;

“My mate is well respected at his firm. It’s nice that his company occasionally provides an opportunity for people who work there to include their spouses to get to know one another. No one there expects me to be up to speed with the inner workings of that environment. In fact, this is a party where they will probably enjoy thinking about things other than their work. Life’s much larger than what happens at my husband’s office. And since I’m never there, I may very well appear to be a breath of fresh air to many of them, because I’m not bogged down in the things that they’re troubled about. Mary seems light and friendly. She’s clearly not bogged down in office politics or problems. It’s fun to watch her. She’s interesting. I wonder where she buys her clothes. Very pretty things she wears.”

&nbsp;

We wanted our friend to see that it’s not necessary to sort out every insecurity that she’d ever felt and use this office party as a means to solve it. We told her, “Just find something positive to focus upon, and feel the benefit of having done so. And in time Mary, or all the Maries, will be a non- issue. In fact, Mary could become your friend. But in any case, it’s your decision to make. You just have to vibration ally practice it to make it so”.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250049"></a>45.  How can I not feel their pain?

** **

Our friend Jerry said to us that it seemed to him that the majority of his discomfort is because of observing others who are in discomfort or in pain. And he wanted to know how he could use the pivoting process to not feel pain about their pain. We explain that whatever the subject of your attention, it contains things that you want to see as well as things that you do not want to see. If you’re feeling pain, it is not because the person that you’re observing is in pain, your pain is because you’ve chosen to look at an aspect of them that causes you to feel pain. And there’s a big difference. Of course, if this person were not feeling pain, but were instead joyful, it would be easier for you to feel joyful. But you must not rely on conditions changing in order to control the way you feel. You must improve your ability to focus positively regardless of the condition. And to do that, it helps to remember that every subject has wanted and unwanted within it. And, if you’re deliberate, you _can_ find something that feels better.

&nbsp;

Of course, it is easier just to observe something that’s right before your eyes, than it is to deliberately sift for things that you would prefer to see. However, when it really matters to you that you feel good, you’ll be less willing to merely lazily or sloppily observe, because your desire to feel good will inspire a greater willingness to look for positive aspects. Also, the more you do look for good feeling things to focus upon, the more of those kinds of good feeling things the LOA will bring to you. Until in time you’ll be so positively oriented that you simply will not notice the things that don’t match your positive orientation.

&nbsp;

We were visiting with a mother at one time, and we encouraged her to just ignore her son’s problems.

And she said, “But won’t he feel like I’ve abandoned him? Don’t I need to be there for him?”

And we explained to her that there is no abandonment in focusing upon the positive aspects of someone’s life. And there is powerful value in abandoning any thoughts that do not feel good when you think them.  We told her, you will never help anyone by being their sounding board for

&nbsp;

Problems or complaints. By holding an image of improvement in your son’s life you help him move toward that. Be _there_ for him. Call him _there_ to _that_ better feeling place.

When it’s your deliberate intention to feel good, and you really care about how you feel, you’ll find more and more thoughts about more and more subjects that do feel good. And then you will be better prepared to interface with others who could be feeling good or bad. Because of your desire to feel good you will have prepared your experience with others with whom you will be interacting. And then it will be much easier for you to focus positively about their situation no matter what sort of mess they’re in. But if you’ve not been tending to your own vibration and you’ve not been consistently holding yourself in good feeling thoughts and vibrations, then you may be swept away into their situation, and you may very well feel discomfort.

&nbsp;

We just want to emphasize that you’re not feeling their pain caused by their situation, but instead you’re feeling your own pain, brought about by your own thinking. There’s great control in that understanding, and, if fact, true freedom. When you discover that you can control the way you feel because you can control the thoughts you think, then you are free to joyously move about your Planet. But when you believe that the way you feel is dependent upon the behavior or situations of others, and you also understand that you have no control over those behaviors or situations, you do not feel free. That, in fact, was the pain that our friend Jerry was describing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250048"></a>46.  My sympathy is of no value to anyone

** **

So then Jerry said to us, “So, when I take my attention off those who are in trouble, I’ll feel good, but still that doesn’t help them feel better. In other words, I haven’t solved the problem; I’m just avoiding the problem”.

And we told him, “If you don’t focus upon their problem, you can continue to feel good. But they’ll still have the problem that is true, at first. But if you do focus upon their problem, you’ll feel bad, they’ll continue to feel bad, and they’ll still have the problem. And if you continue to focus upon their problem, in time you will have the problem too. However, if you don’t focus upon their problem but instead you try to imagine their solution or a positive outcome, you’ll feel good. And then there is the possibility of your influencing them to more positive thoughts and outcomes”.

&nbsp;

In simple terms, you are never of value to another and you never offer a solution when you are feeling negative emotion. Because the presence of negative emotion within your means you’re focused upon the lack of what is wanted rather than what is wanted. So, if someone is having a bad experience and they come into your awareness with a powerful wind of negativity rapped around

&nbsp;

them, if you have not already deliberately achieved your alignment with feeling food, you may be swept into their negativity, you may become part of their chain of pain, and you may very well then pass your discomfort onto another who will then pass it onto another, and so on. But if you have been deliberately setting the tone of your day, but putting your head on your pillow each night and saying, “Tonight, as I sleep, all attraction will stop, which means tomorrow I will have a new beginning, and tomorrow I will look for what I’m wanting to see, because I want to feel good, because feeling good is the most important thing”, as you awaken in the morning, you will be upon a fresh path, bringing no negativity from the day before. And then, as you walk into a room and you see someone with pain coming toward you, as this person comes with his pain, you don’t become part of it, but instead you provide a better example of happiness. For that which you feel is that which you radiate.

&nbsp;

Now, it’s not likely that just because you remain happy, others will immediately join you in your happiness. In fact, when there’s a great disparity between the way you are feeling and the way others are feeling, you will have a difficult time relating to one another. But in time, if you maintain your positive vibrational stance, they will either join you in your positive place, or they will vibrate right out of your experience. The only way unhappy people can stay in your experience is by your continuing attention to them and their unhappiness.

If you and two other people were walking along a mountain ledge, and you were not watching where you were going and you stumbled and fell over the edge, and you were hanging by a very flimsy vine, and one of your friends was very strong and surefooted, and the other was very clumsy and not focused, which one would you be glad was there?

&nbsp;

Looking for the positive aspects is the way you find your sure footing. It is who-you-are from an Inner perspective. And as you consistently align with increasingly better feeling thoughts, the powerful resources of the Universe become available to you.

&nbsp;

To sympathize with another means to focus upon their situation until you feel as they feel. And since everyone has the potential of feeling wonderful or feeling awful, of succeeding at their desires or of failing at their desires, you have options abut which aspects of them you sympathize with. We encourage you to sympathize with the best feeling aspects of others that you can find. And in doing so, you may influence them to an improved condition also.

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250047"></a>47.  To not hurt when they feel hurt

** **

A man once asked us, “How do you end a relationship without being hurt by the other person being hurt? If you decide that it’s time to move on, and the other person is not ready to move on, so he or she is distraught, how can you keep your balance in a situation like that?”

And we said to him, when you attempt to guide your behavior by paying attention to how someone else feels about your behavior, you’re powerless. Because you cannot control their perspective, and therefore you cannot achieve any consistent improvement in your own vibration or point of attraction or how you feel. If you’ve decided to take the action of leaving a relationship before you’ve done the vibrational work of focusing upon what you want and why you want it, any action that you take can only bring you more of the same discomfort that you’ve been experiencing. And even once the relationship is ended and you’re alone or beginning another relationship with another person, those old lingering negative vibrations will not allow a pleasant unfolding. In other words, it’s so much better to find your vibrational balance before you take the action of separation, or you may experience a rather long time of discomfort.

&nbsp;

We told our friend, let’s examine the components of the situation and bring some clarity to your options. You’ve come to the conclusion, as a result of being unhappy in this relationship for a while, that it would be better to end it. In other words, you believe that your chance of happiness is greater outside of the relationship than inside it. But when you announce that to your partner, your partner becomes even unhappy. And now because your partner is unhappy, you are unhappy. One option is to stay. To say, “Never, mind, don’t be unhappy. I’ve changed my mind. I’ll stay”. But all that has happened is that you were both feeling unhappy, you made a decision to leave, which made your partner even more unhappy, and now you’ve pulled back from that decision, so your partner is not quite as unhappy as before, but still neither of you are happy. So nothing has changed except that things got a bit more intense for a while. But basically, you’re still unsatisfied and unhappy in this relationship.

&nbsp;

Another option is to just leave. You could focus upon all of the things that have caused you to feel uncomfortable in the relationship and use those things as your justification for leaving, and while that negative focus upon negative things will give you the conviction to take the action of leaving, you will really not feel that much better. While you may feel some relief from the intensity of your unhappiness once you’re on the outside of the relationship, you’ll continue to feel a need to justify your action of leaving, which will continue to hold you in an unpleasant state. So, even though you’ve walked away from the things that were really bothering you, you’ll still feel bothered.

&nbsp;

Really, there is nothing that you can do to prevent others from feeling bad, because they don’t feel bad because of your behavior. There is no greater entrapment in relationship or in life than an attempt to keep others happy by observing their emotions and then trying to compensate with your actions. The only way you can be happy is to decide to be happy. When you take upon yourself the responsibility of someone else’s happiness, you’re attempting the impossible and you’re setting yourself up for a great deal of personal discord.

&nbsp;

So now let’s consider the options of pivoting and positive aspects. Stay where you are for now, making no big change in your action or behavior. In other words, if you’re living together, continue to do so; if you’re spending time together, continue to do so. This option is a change in your thought process, not your action process. The process of pivoting and the process of positive aspects are designed to help you focus differently and to begin telling the story of your relationship or of your life in a better feeling, more self-empowering way. For example,

&nbsp;

“I’ve been thinking about leaving this relationship because I find that I am not happy within it. But as I think about leaving I realize that when I go I’ll take myself with me, and if I leave because I’m unhappy, I’ll be taking that unhappy person with me. The reason that I want to leave is because I want to feel good. I wonder if it’s possible to feel good without leaving. I wonder if there’s anything about our relationship that I could focus upon that does feel good. I remember meeting this person and how that felt. I remember feeling drawn by this person and eager to move forward to see what more we might discover together. I liked the feeling of discovery; I liked our relationship as it began. I think that the more time we spent together, the more we realized that we were not really a perfect match. I don’t believe that there is any failure on either of our parts in that. Not being a perfect match doesn’t mean that either of us is wrong. It only means that there are potentially better partners out there for each of us. There are so many things about this person that I like and that anyone would easily appreciate: so smart and interested in so many things, laughs easily, likes to have fun. I’m glad that we’ve come together. And I believe that our time together will prove to be of value to both of us”.

&nbsp;

So, our answer to this important question is, you cannot control the pain that any other feels by modifying your behavior. You can, however, control your own pain by directing your thoughts until your pain subsides and is replaced by improved feelings. As you give your attention to what you’re wanting, you will always begin to feel good. As you give your attention to the lack of what you’re wanting, you will always feel bad. And if you give your attention to the lack of what someone else is wanting, you will feel bad also.

&nbsp;

You’re so action oriented as physical beings that you really think that you have to fix everything right now. Your partner did not get to this place all of a sudden; your partner did not even get there only during your relationship. It’s been a long path, momentum has been gathering along the way. So, don’t expect that a conversation that you’re having in this moment is going to make all of the difference. See yourself as one who is planting a seed, a very strong, sure, powerful seed. You’ve planted it perfectly, and you’ve nurtured it for a time with your words so that long after you’re gone that seed will continue to blossom into that which it is to be.

&nbsp;

There are many relationships that are not appropriate for you to continue. But we would never walk out of a relationship feeling angry or guilty or defensive. Does the vibrational work, get to feeling good, and then leave. And then what comes next will not be a replay of what you just left.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250046"></a>48.   I am not responsible for others’ creations

** **

You must not accept the responsibility for what others are doing in their own life experience. See them as emerging from the lack and know that it’s going to get better for them later. And then you’ll begin to feel better. You may even inspire them in their sleep state to an improved direction. When you think about them, see them as happy. Don’t regurgitate in your mind the sad conversations you’ve had, or the parting. Instead, envision them as getting on with their life, just as you’re getting on with yours. Trust that they have the guidance within them to find their own way.

What trips most of you up so often in your wanting to help others is that you believe, “They need me, because they can’t help themselves”. But that belief is detrimental to them, because down deep inside they know they _can_ do it, and they want to do it.

Begin to say things to your partner such as,

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“You’re such a wonderful person. And while we haven’t connected on as many levels as I would like, I know there’s a perfect partner waiting for you, and I’m releasing you to that opportunity. Look for it. I don’t want to keep you caged here, captive to something that neither one of us wants. I want to free us both to that which we both are wanting. I am not telling you goodbye forever, I’m saying, let’s let this relationship have a new understanding between us, one that’s inspired from passionate positive desire, not one that’s whipped into place because we’re afraid of the possible consequences”.

&nbsp;

And then say to the person,

&nbsp;

“When I think of you, I will always know that while you’re sad now, you’re going to be happy later. I’m going to choose to see you as happy because that’s the way I like you best. And that’s what you like best too”.

&nbsp;

This may sound tough or cold. But nothing else makes sense.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250045"></a>49.  Listen for guidance or reach for good feelings?

** **

You have the ability to pivot under any and all conditions. It does not matter how negative something seems, you have the ability to give your attention to the positive aspects of it. The only things that get in your way are some old habits or maybe some strong influence from others. Most people are habitual in nature. And your patterns are so well entrenched that at times the fastest path to the joy you seek is for you to take your pivot as you sleep, and then awaken in the new day already in the direction of what you’re wanting.

&nbsp;

By reaching for good feeling thoughts before you go to sleep, and then experiencing the benefit of the quite mind that occurs while you sleep, and then upon awakening immediately turning to good feeling thoughts, you can accomplish the ultimate pivoting experience. A few days of following that pattern will provide a big change in your habit of thought and your point of attraction. And you’ll discover immediate improvement in virtually every aspect of your life.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250044"></a>50.  What if I played the if..? Game?

** **

As we encourage that you do your best to find positive aspects upon whatever subject is before you, there are often those who ask, “But what about the man who just lost his job and has a wife and five children and his rent is due in two days and he doesn’t have the money to pay it?” or, “What about the woman who has the Gestapo army at her door about to take her to be killed in a gas chamber? How could these people pivot?” And to those extreme questions we often reply, it’s as if you’ve jumped out of an airplane at an altitude of 20.000 feet and you have no parachute and so you’re saying, “Now what do I do?”

&nbsp;

You’re usually not faced with such extreme circumstances from which it seems there is no possible comfortable escape. However, these extreme situations, with all of the drama and trauma that they bring, also bring a power that, with the right focus, can provide resolutions that someone watching from the outside would find astonishing or even miraculous. In other words, there is no situation from which you cannot find a positive resolution, but you have to be able to focus powerfully in

&nbsp;

order to accomplish such a solution. And most people, who are in those kinds of situations, are not adept at that kind of focus, which is why they’re experiencing the negative situation to begin with.

&nbsp;

When you’re involved in extreme situations, a power comes forth from within, and so the intensity of your desire will put you upon a plateau where if you can just get focused you can have your greater elevation. In other words, those who are very sick, are in a better position to be even more well than most others, because their desire for Wellness is amplified. But unless they’re able to pivot or to turn their attention to their desire for Wellness and away from their concern about illness, they cannot become well.

&nbsp;

We would encourage you to play the if..? Game, looking for positive aspects. In other words, rather than looking into your society for examples of disempowered people, having no control over the circumstances of their lives, tell a story that gives you a feeling of empowerment. Instead of telling stories of powerless victims, and amplifying your own feeling of being a victim, tell a different story. For example,

&nbsp;

What if this woman before the Gestapo army came pounding on her door had recognized the rumblings of the looming holocaust that were in the community weeks before?

What if she’d left the community when many others had left? What if she had not been afraid of the unknown?

What if she had not held to the familiar?

What if she’d made the decision to start a new life in a new country with her sister and her aunt and uncle two weeks ago so that she was not at home when the Gestapo came calling?

&nbsp;

When you play the if..? Game, look for things you _do_ want to see. Look for things that make you feel better. There is never a situation in which there is not a way out. In fact, there are hundreds and thousands of practical choices along the way. But out of habit most people continue to choose the lack perspective in situations, until they eventually find themselves in an unwanted place where it seems that there are no more choices.

&nbsp;

As you hold to your intention to look for evidence of Well-Being and thriving and success and happiness, you will tune yourself to the vibrations of those things. And so, those kinds of good feeling experiences will dominate your life.

&nbsp;

“Today, no matter where I am going, no matter what I am doing, it is my dominant intent to look for what I want to see”. As you make the decision that you are not a mere observer of your

&nbsp;

World, but a deliberate positive contributor to your world, you’ll find great pleasure in your involvement with what’s going on upon your Planet. When you witness things that you do not want to happen in your world, in your nation, in your neighborhood, in your family, or even in your personal body, and you remember that you have the power to tell a different story, and you also know that there is enormous power in telling a different story, you will then step back into the exuberant knowledge that you held when you made the decision to come forth to participate on this Planet to begin with.

You cannot be in a place other than where you are right now. But you do have the power to begin to express your perspective about where you are in increasingly better ways. And as you do that consciously and deliberately, you will see the evidence of the power of your focus on every subject to which you turn your attention.

&nbsp;

As you make the decision that you want to feel good, and you consciously look for positive aspects within the subjects that you’re involved in every day, and as you deliberately identify and focus upon what you do want, regarding these subjects, you’ll set yourself upon a path of eternal unfolding satisfaction and joy.

&nbsp;

These processes are simple to understand and to apply. But don’t let their simplicity cause you to underestimate their power. Consistently apply them and show yourself the leverage of the power of aligned thought. Discover the power of the Energy that creates worlds. The power that you have always had ready access to, but which you now understand how to apply and focus it toward your own personal creations.

## <a name="_TOC_250043"></a>Part II. Attracting Money and Manifesting Abundance

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250042"></a>51.  Attracting money and manifesting abundance

** **

While money is not absolutely essential to your experience, to most people money and freedom are synonymous. And since an intense awareness of your right to be free is at the very core of that which you are, it then follows that your relationship with money is one of the most important subjects of your life experience. And so, it’s no wonder you have such strong feelings about the subject of money. Although some people have discovered the freedom of allowing large amounts of money to flow through their experience, it’s more often the case that because you’re experiencing far less money than you need or desire, most of you are not feeling free. It is our intention here to clearly explain why this financial disparity exists, so that you can begin to allow the abundance that you want and deserve into your experience. As you read these words, and as you begin to resonate with these Law based truths, you will align your desire with the abundance of your world and then the evidence of your new found alignment will soon become apparent to you and others who observe you. Whether you’re one who’s been working to achieve financial abundance for many years or you’re a youngster just starting down that path, the journey to financial Well-Being does not have to be a long one from where you are. And it does not require large amounts of time or physical effort, for we’re going to explain to you in simple and easy to understand terms how to utilize the leverage of Energy that’s available to you. We want to show you the absolute correlation between the thoughts you’ve been thinking about money, the way you feel when you think those thoughts and the money that flows into your experience. When you’re able to consciously make that correlation, and you decide to deliberately direct your thoughts accordingly, you’ll access the power of the Universe and you’ll then see how time and physical effort are rather irrelevant to your financial success.

&nbsp;

So, we’ll begin with the simple premise of your Universe and of your world – YOU GET WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT. Often people say to us, “That can’t be true, because I’ve wanted and thought about money for as long as I can remember, but I continue to struggle and not have enough money”. And what we tell them then is the most important thing for you to understand if you want to improve your financial situation &#8211; the subject of money is really two subjects: money, plenty of money, the feeling of freedom and ease that plenty of money can provide, and absence of money, not nearly enough money, the feeling of fear or disappointment that the thought of absence of money induces. Often people assume that because they’re speaking the words “I want more money”, they’re speaking positively about money. But when you’re speaking of money, or anything, and you’re feeling fear or discomfort as you speak, you’re not speaking about the subject

&nbsp;

Of money, but instead you’re speaking about the subject of not enough money. And the difference is very important because the first statement brings money, and the second holds it away.

&nbsp;

It is of value for you to become aware of how you are really thinking, and, more important, how you’re feeling about money. If you’re thinking or saying things like, “Oh, that’s a very beautiful thing, but I can’t afford it”, you’re not in the vibrational place to allow the abundance in that you desire. The feeling of disappointment that is present as you acknowledge that you cannot afford it is your indicator that the balance of your thought is pointed more toward the lack of your desire than toward the desire itself. The negative emotion that you feel as you acknowledge that you cannot afford something that you want is one way of understanding the balance of your thoughts, and the amount of abundance that you’re actually experiencing is another way of knowing it.

&nbsp;

Many people continue to perpetuate the experience of not enough in their lives simply because they don’t think beyond the reality of what they’re actually experiencing. In other words, if they’re experiencing the shortage of money, and are aware of it and speak of it often, they hold themselves in that chronic position. And so, many people protest when we explain to them the power of telling the story of their finances as they want it to be rather than as it is, because they believe that they should be factual about what’s happening. But we want you to understand that if you continue to look at what-is and speak of what-is, you will not find the improvement that you desire. You may see a parade of changing faces and places, but your life experience will essentially show no improvement.

&nbsp;

If you want to effect substantial change in your life experience, you have to offer substantially different vibrations, which mean you must think thoughts that feel different as you think them.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250041"></a>52.  Sacksful action doesn‘t pay off

** **

** **

Jerry: Abraham, many years ago I owned a motel down near El Paso, TX, and one of the wealthiest men in the United States (he was one of the multibillionaires) called me. He purchased a small resort down on the Rio Grande River that was financially failing. And he‘d heard that I might have some useful information to help him turn it around. As we were visiting in my little coffee shop, I had a difficult time focusing on our conversation, because I just couldn‘t understand why a man, that wealthy, would be still discontent and looking for a way of making more money. I wondered why he didn‘t just sell the place at whatever price and go on about his life enjoying the money he‘d already accumulated. And I have another friend who is in multibillionaire class. We were in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, walking on the beach, a few years ago. And he was talking about some business

&nbsp;

Problems he was having. And it really struck me that that man, so wealthy, would have any kinds of troubles. But what I’ve learned from you, Abraham, and I’ve learned a lot from you, is that our true success in life is not about how much money we have, or about having the things, right?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250040"></a>53.  First I‘ll find vibrational balance

** **

The things that you have and the things that you do are all meant to enhance your state of being. In other words, it‘s all about how you feel, and how you feel is all about coming into alignment with who-you-really-are. When you tend to your alignment first, then the things you gather and the actions you perform only enhance your good feeling state of being. But if you do not find that vibrational balance first, and attempt to make yourself feel better by bringing more things into your experience, or participating in more activities, in order to try to make yourself feel better, you just get further out of balance.

&nbsp;

We’re not guiding you away from accumulating things or from taking action, because all of that is an essential part of your physical experience. In other words, you intended the wonderful experience of exploring the details of your physical world in order to help you personally determine your own joyous growth and expansion. But when you try to move forward form an imbalanced footing, it’s always uncomfortable.

&nbsp;

If you’ll begin by identifying how you want to feel, or be, and then let your inspiration to accumulate or do come from that centered place, then not only will you maintain your balance, but you will now enjoy the things that you gather and the things that you do.

&nbsp;

Most people do most of their wanting from a place of lack. They want things in many cases simply because they do not have them. So the having of them does not really satisfy anything deep within them because there’s always something else that they do not have. And so it becomes a never- ending struggle to try to bring one more thing, one more thing that still will not be satisfying, into their experience. “Because I don’t have this, I want it.” And then they really think that getting it will fill the void. But that defies Law.

&nbsp;

Any action that’s taken from a place of lack is always counterproductive, and it always leads to more of a feeling of lack.

&nbsp;

The void that these people are feeling cannot be filled with things or satisfied with action, because the feeling of void is about the vibrational discord between their desires and their chronic habits of thought. Offering better feeling thoughts, telling a different story, looking for positive aspects,

&nbsp;

Pivoting to the subject of what you really do want, looking for positive what-ifs – that’s how you fill that void. And when you do, a most interesting thing will occur in your experience – the things you’ve wanted will begin to flood into your experience. But these things that you’ve been wanting will flood into your experience not to fill your void, because that void no longer exists, they flow in _because_ your void no longer exists. Certainly, you will gather many magnificent things into your experience. Our message is not for you to stop wanting, having or doing. Our message is for you to want and accumulate and do from your place of feeling good.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250039"></a>54.  Neither money nor poverty makes joy

** **

Jerry: Abraham, there‘s a saying that money doesn‘t make for a happiness. But on the other hand, I have noticed that poverty doesn’t make for happiness either. But still it’s obvious that money isn’t the path to happiness. So, if the idea of achieving something does bring us happiness, does that mean that the achievement is an appropriate goal for us to set? And how does a person maintain his or her feeling of happiness when reaching one’s goal is taking a lot of their time and energy? In other words, it often seems that it’s a sort of uphill climb to reach the goal, and then there is a short plateau of rest, but then an almost immediate tedious climb to achieve the next goal. In other words, how does a person keep all of the climbing toward their goals joyous, so there is not that struggle, struggle, struggle, and then, “Wow, I’ve made it!”, and then struggle, struggle, struggle, and, “Oh, here, I’ve made it again!”?

&nbsp;

Abraham: You‘re right, money is not the path to happiness, and, as you‘ve observed, poverty certainly is not the path to happiness either. It‘s so important to remember, that when you offer any action for the purpose of achieving happiness, you’re truly going about it in a backward way. Instead, use your ability to focus your thoughts and words toward things that cause you to feel better and better, and once you’ve deliberately achieved a state  of happiness, not only will wonderful actions be inspired, but wonderful results must follow.

&nbsp;

Most people give the majority of their attention to whatever is happening in their experience right now, which means, if the results please them, they feel good, but if the results do not please them, they feel bad. But that’s really going about life the hard way. If you only have the ability to see what-is, then things cannot improve. You must find a way to look optimistically forward in order to achieve any improvement in your experience.

&nbsp;

When you learn how to deliberately focus your thoughts toward good-feeling things, it’s not difficult to find happiness and maintain it even before your goal has been accomplished. The feeling

&nbsp;

Of struggle you were describing happens because of the continual comparison of where you are right now in relationship to the goal you’re reaching for. When you’re constantly taking score, noticing the distance that still needs to be traveled, you amplify the distance, the task, the effort, and that’s why it feels like such an uphill struggle.

&nbsp;

When you care about how you feel, and so you choose thoughts on the basis of how they feel, you then develop patterns of thought that are more forward looking. And as the LOA then responds to those better-feeling thoughts, you get more pleasing results. Struggle, struggle, struggle never leads to a happy ending. It defies Law. “When I get there then I’ll be happy” is not a productive mindset, because unless you’re happy, you can’t get there. When you decide to first be happy, then you’ll get there.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250038"></a>55.  I am here as a joyful creator

** **

You’re not here as accumulators or regurgitates. You’re here as creators. When you’re looking toward an ending place, you exaggerate the feeling of lack between where you are now and that ending place. And that habit of thought can not only slow the progress of your creation, but can hold it apart from you indefinitely. You are the attractor of your experience. As you look for positive aspects and make an effort to find good-feeling thoughts, you will hold yourself in a place of positive attraction, and what you want will come faster. The sculptor of a work of art does not derive his greatest satisfaction from the finished piece. It is the process of creation, the sculpting of the piece that gives him pleasure. That’s the way we would like you to view your physical experience of creating – continual joyful becoming.

&nbsp;

As you focus your attention upon things that feel good, and achieve a consistently joyful state of being, you’ll then be in the position of attracting more of whatever you want. Sometimes people complain that it seems unfair that they have to become happy before things that bring them more happiness can then come to them. They believe that when they are unhappy, they need the happy events to come, but when they are already happy, then the happy events are unnecessary. But that would defy the LOA. You have to find a way of feeling the essence of what you desire before the details of that desire can come to you. In other words, you have to begin to _feel_ more prosperous before more prosperity can come.

&nbsp;

Often people tell us that they want more money, and when we ask them what their balance of thought is about money, they tell us that they have very positive attitude about money. But as we probe a bit deeper, asking them how they feel when they sit to pay their bills, they often then realize

&nbsp;

that while they may have been attempting to sound positive about the subject, they’ve actually been feeling a great deal of worry or even fear around the subject of money. In other words, often without realizing it the majority of their thoughts about money have been on the “not enough” side of the subject rather than on the “abundance” side of the subject.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250037"></a>56.  The power of vibration ally spending vibrational money

** **

Here’s a process that can quickly help you shift the balance of your thoughts regarding money to a place where you can begin to let more money flow easily into your experience:

&nbsp;

Put 100 dollars in your pocket and keep it with you at all times. As you move through your day, deliberately notice how many things you could exchange this money for: “I could purchase that”, “I could do that”. Someone said to us that 100 dollars doesn’t really buy that much in today’s economy. But we explain that if you mentally spend that 100 dollars 1000 times today, you’ve vibration ally spent 100.000 dollars. That sort of positive focus will dramatically change your vibrational balance about money.

&nbsp;

This vibrational spending process will cause you to feel differently about money, and when that happens, your point of attraction will shift, and more money must flow into your experience. It is Law.

&nbsp;

Someone said to us, “I didn’t have 100 dollars, but I put an IOU in my pocket”. And we said, that’s defeating the process, because you’re walking around with the feeling of debt in your pocket, which is exactly the opposite of what you want to do. You want to feel your prosperity. And so, even if it’s only 20 or 50 or if it’s a 1000 or 10.000 that you have in your pocket, utilize it effectively to help you notice how good things are now. Because in your acknowledgement of your prosperous now your prosperity must become more.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250036"></a>57.  Needing money won’t attract it

** **

Jerry: Abraham, one of my greatest disappointments, as I’ve worked to help people find greater financial success, is that those who needed the money the most, had the least success with what I was teaching them, while those who needed it the least, seemed to have the most success with it. That always seemed backward to me. It seemed like those who needed it more would try harder and eventually they should have succeeded.

&nbsp;

Abraham: Anyone who is in the place of lack, no matter how much action they offer, attracts more lack. In other words, the powerful feeling outweighs any action that they offer. Any action that’s offered from a place of lack is always counterproductive. Those who were not feeling need were not in a place of lack, so their action was productive.

Your experience was in absolute harmony with the LOA. As is every experience. There is not a shred of evidence anywhere in the Universe that is to the contrary of this that we are speaking of.

&nbsp;

Jerry: Also, what I noticed was that those people who hadn’t achieved much success or weren’t very interested in even hearing about achieving success were people who’d been taught that to want money was evil or immoral, and that the best thing for them to do was to remain where they were, even though they were unfulfilled.

&nbsp;

Abraham: The reason that many reach a place where they say that they do not have desire is because they’ve wanted and wanted and wanted, but because they’ve not understood that every subject is two subjects, they’ve given more of their attention to the lack of what they’ve wanted than to what they want. And so, they continue to attract the lack of what they want. And then eventually they were just worn down by it. As a person begins to associate wanting with not having so much so that to want is an unpleasant experience, then he says, “I no longer want, because every time I want something, I get myself in this place of discomfort. So it’s easier for me to just not want in the first place”.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250035"></a>58.  What if a “poor” one doesn’t feel poor?

** **

Jerry: Well, if others who are noticing you and comparing you to themselves come to the conclusion that you’re poor, but you don’t feel poor, then you wouldn’t be in a state of lack, and so you would be able to move quickly toward more abundance in that case, right?

&nbsp;

Abraham: That is correct. Others’ assessment of you has no bearing on your point of attraction. Unless you’re bothered by their assessment. Comparing your experience to the experiences of others can amplify a feeling of lack within you if you come to the conclusion that they’ve succeeded more greatly than you have, and then you activate within yourself a feeling of being less than. Also noticing a lack of prosperity in the experiences of others does not put you in a place of attracting greater prosperity for yourself, because you’ll be getting what you think about.

&nbsp;

What you draw to you or keep from you has nothing to do with what anyone else is doing. An improved feeling of prosperity, even if your current reality does not justify the feeling, will always bring more prosperity to you. Paying attention to the way you feel about money is a much more productive activity than noticing how others are doing.

&nbsp;

Allowing more money to flow into your experience requires far less than most people understand. All that’s required is that you achieve a vibrational balance in your own thoughts:

If you want more money but you doubt you can achieve it, you’re not in balance;

If you want more money but you believe there’s something wrong in having money, you’re not in balance;

If you want more money and you’re angry at those who have more money, you’re not in balance.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When you’re feeling those emotions of inadequacy, insecurity, jealousy, injustice, anger, and so on, your emotional guidance system is letting you know that you’re out of alignment with your own desire. Most people make no effort in coming into personal alignment with the subject of money. Instead, they spend years, even lifetimes, pointing out perceived injustices, attempting to define the rightness or the wrongness of the subject, and even trying to put laws in place to orchestrate the flow of money in the civilization. When a rather small effort, in comparison with the impossible attempt at controlling those outside circumstances, would yield them an enormous return.

&nbsp;

Nothing is more important than that you feel good, for when you feel good, you’re in harmony with your greater intent. Many believe that hard work and struggle are not only a requirement to achieve success, but that working hard and struggling long is a more honorable way of living life. Those hard times of struggle certainly do help you in the defining of what you desire. But until you release the feeling of struggle, what you desire cannot come into your experience.

&nbsp;

Often people feel as if they need to prove their worthiness and that once that is accomplished, then and only then will rewards be given. But we want you to know that you’re already worthy. And that proving you worthy is not only not possible, but not necessary. What is necessary for you to receive the rewards or benefits that you seek is alignment with the essence of those benefits. You have to first bring yourself into vibrational alignment with the experience you wish to live.

&nbsp;

We know that words do not teach and that our knowledge regarding the Laws of the Universe and of your value does not necessarily mean that now you’ve read our words that you know your value. However, as you consider the premises that we are laying out for you here, and as you begin the

&nbsp;

Application of the processes that we’re suggesting here, it’s our knowing that the Universe’s response to your improved vibration will give you the evidence of the existence of these Laws. It will not be long and it will not require much deliberate application of what you’re hearing here before you will be convinced of your own value and of your ability to create whatever you desire. The primary reason that people do not believe in their own value is because they often have not found a way to get what they want, so they incorrectly assume that someone outside of them does not approve, and that somehow withholding the reward. That is never true. You are the creator of your experience.

&nbsp;

Make statements, such as,

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“I want to be the best that I can be. I want to do and have and live in a way that’s in harmony with my idea of the greatest good. I want to harmonize physically here in this body with that which I believe to be the best or the good way of life.”

&nbsp;

If you’ll make those statements and then don’t take action unless you feel good, you will always is moving upon the path in harmony with your idea of that which is good.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250034"></a>59.  What is my financial abundance story?

** **

A belief in lack is the reason that more people are not allowing themselves the financial abundance they desire. When you believe that there is a finite pile of abundance, and that there’s not enough to go around, and so you feel injustice when someone has more than others, believing that because they have it, others are deprived of having it, you’re holding yourself apart from abundance. It’s not another’s achievement of success that’s responsible for your lack of achievement, but rather your negative comparison and your attention to the lack of your own desire. When you feel the negative emotion that you feel as you accuse others of injustice or of squandering wealth or hording, or when you simply believe that there’s not enough to go around, you hold yourself in the position of denying your own improved condition.

&nbsp;

What anyone else has or does not have has nothing to do with you. The only thing that affects your experience is the way you utilize the Non-Physical Energy with your thought. Your abundance or lack of it in your experience has nothing to do with what anyone else is doing or having. It has only to do with your perspective. It has only to do with your offering of thought. If you want your fortune to shift, you have to begin telling a different story.

&nbsp;

Many people criticize those who are living well, who accumulate land and money and things. And that criticism is symptomatic of their own sacksful habit of thought. They want to feel better and often believe that if they can make that which they are unable to achieve wrong, then they will feel better. But they never do feel better, because their attention to lack perpetuates lack everywhere they look. They would not feel uncomfortable in seeing someone else’s achievement if that desire for achievement were not present within themselves as well. And that criticism that they often keep alive within themselves only serves to hold them in vibrational discord with what they want. In other words, if someone called you on the telephone and said, “Hello, you don’t know me. I’m just calling to tell you that I’ll never call you again”, you would not feel negative emotion about the caller’s absence from your life, because his presence was not something that you desired to begin with. But if someone you care about were to make that announcement to you, you would feel strong negative emotion, because your desire and your belief would then be at odds.

&nbsp;

When you feel negative emotion about anything, it always means that you have a desire that has been born from your personal life experience that you are right now opposing with other thoughts. Vibrational discord is always the reason for negative emotion. And negative emotion is always guidance to help you redirect your thoughts to find vibrational alignment with who-you-really-are and with your current desires.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250033"></a>60.   What if the poor criticize the rich?

** **

Jerry: Abraham, when I was a kid, I associated with poor people primarily. And we used to make fun of those who were wealthy. We criticized those who drove luxury cars, for instance. And so, as an adult, when it came time that I would like to have owned a “Cadillac”, I couldn’t bring myself to drive one, because I felt that people would now make fun of me as I’d made fun of the others. So, I drove a “Mercedes”, because years ago people kind of thought they were economy cars. But the only way I could bring myself to drive a “Cadillac”, which I finally did, was to bridge my thoughts by saying, “Well, by buying this car I put all these people to work who put this car together. I created jobs for all the people who supplied the parts and the materials: the leather, the metal, the glass, and so on”. And in that justification then I was able to buy the car.

So, somehow I discovered a process of bridging my thoughts that helped me to allow that symbol of success into my experience.

&nbsp;

Abraham: Your process of bridging thoughts is an effective one.

&nbsp;

When you want to feel good and you gradually find increasingly better-feeling thoughts, you’re bringing yourself into alignment with your desire and you’re releasing the resistance that is preventing your improved conditions. Focusing on opposing opinions of others is never productive because it always causes discord within you, which also prevents your improved condition. There will always be others who disagree with you, and your attention to them will always because you to vibration ally disagree with your own desires. Listen to your own guidance system by paying attention to how you’re feeling in order to determine the appropriateness of your desires and behaviors. There will always be someone, no matter which side of any subject you choose, who does not harmonize with you. And that’s why we speak so firmly and want so much for you to understand that your greatest endeavor is to find harmony with who-you-really-are.

&nbsp;

If you would trust in yourself, if you could believe that through all that you’ve lived you’ve come to a place of very strong knowing, and that you can trust the way you feel as your personal form of guidance about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of what you’re contemplating doing, then you would utilize your guidance system in the way that it was really intended.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250032"></a>61.  What if our money loses value?

** **

Jerry: Abraham, in the past our money was primarily coins, metal that had a value in and of itself, like the 20 dollar gold piece &#8211; the gold itself was worth 20 dollars, and the silver in the silver dollar had value. And so, it seems simple to understand the value of the coin. But now our money in and of itself has no actual value. In other words, the paper and coins are essentially valueless. I’ve always appreciated the convenience of money as a way of exchanging goods and talents rather than trading, let’s say, a chicken for a container of milk or for a basket of potatoes. But now our money is being artificially devalued. And it’s becoming increasingly difficult to really understand the value of a dollar. In other words, it reminds me of my own searching for my own value, like how much is my talent worth? How much should I ask for an exchange for the time and energy that I put forth? But now I’m learning from you that we don’t have to consider our value in that way. We only have to consider what it is we want and then to allow it in. I’m aware that many people are feeling insecure about their financial future; because they feel they don’t have control over what may happen to the value of the dollar, because it’s typically just a handful of people who seem to control or manipulate that. Many worry that there’s going to be more inflation or even another depression. I’d like people to understand what you’ve been teaching us about the LOA, so that they won’t be concerned with things that are outside their control, like the value of the dollar.

&nbsp;

Abraham: You’ve hit upon something very essential here, regarding the subject of money, because you’re right, many of you are recognizing that the dollars today just are not worth what they were at one time. But that’s another position of lack you very often stand firmly upon that keeps you from attracting the abundance that is yours.

&nbsp;

We’d like you to understand that the dollar and its assigned value are really not as important to your experience as your believing. And that if you could put your attention upon what you’re wanting, in terms of being and then having and then doing, that all of the money or other means for bringing about what you want could then flow easily and much more effortlessly into your experience.

We keep coming back to the same terminology. From your place of lack you cannot attract its opposite. And so it really is a matter of adjusting your thinking so that your thinking harmonizes with what feels good to you. Every thought that you think vibrates, and it’s by virtue of having that vibrating thought that you attract. When you think a thought of lack that thought’s vibrating at a place that is so alien to that which you’re Inner-Being knows to be, that your Inner-Being cannot resonate with you at all. And the resulting feeling within you is one of negative emotion. When you think a thought of upliftment or abundance or Well-Being, those thoughts do harmonize with what your Inner-Being knows to be, and under those conditions you’re filled with a feeling of positive emotion. You can trust that the way you feel is the indicator about which side of the subject that you’re on. Whether it’s a subject of money or lack of it, or health or lack of it, or relationship or lack of it, always when you feel good you’re in the place of attracting what you’re wanting.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250031"></a>62.  To reverse a downward spiral

** **

Jerry: When I would see people having financial problems, I used to worry about them. I would watch as they spiral down till they would finally come crashing down in bankruptcy. But then in a very short time they’d have another new boat, a new luxury car, and another beautiful home. In other words, no one I watched seemed to stay down. But why couldn’t they stop the downward spiral somewhere earlier along the way and start back upward sooner? Why did so many of them have to go all the way to the bottom before they could start back up again?

&nbsp;

Abraham: Well, the reason for any downward spiral is attention to lack. In their fear that they might lose something or in their attention to the things that they were losing they were focused upon the lack of what they wanted, and as long as that was their point of attention, only more loss was possible. As they felt guarded or defensive, or as they began to justify or rationalize or blame, they were on the lack side of the equation, and only more lack could be their experience. But once they

&nbsp;

Hit bottom and were no longer in a place of guardedness, because there was nothing else to lose, then their attention shifted and so their vibration shifted, so their point of attraction shifted. Hitting what they believed to is the bottom caused them to begin to look up. You could say that it forced them to begin telling a different story.

&nbsp;

Your life experience has caused you to ask for many wonderful things that are making their way into your experience, but your worry or your doubt or your fear or resentment or blame or jealousy, or any number of negative emotions, would indicate that the predominate thoughts you were thinking were holding those things away. It would be as if you’d drawn them right outside your door but the door was closed. As you begin telling a different story of the things you could buy with your 100 dollar bill, as you relax and focus more upon the positive aspects of your life, as you more deliberately choose the better-feeling end of the vibrational stick, that door will open and you will be flooded with manifestations of those wanted things and experiences and relationships.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250030"></a>63.  A war against war is war

** **

Recognizing that you the creator of your own experience and learning to deliberately do so by directing your thoughts are an adjustment for most people, because most people believe that you make things happen through action. Not only have you believe that action is what makes things happen, but you also believe that if you apply pressure to unwanted things, they’ll go away. And although you may believe that pushing against those unwanted things will cause them to leave your experience, that’s not how the Laws of the Universe work. And that’s not the proof of your experience either, for all of those wars are getting bigger. Attention to the lack of what is wanted causes it to increase and come closer to you. Just as focusing upon what is wanted causes it to increase and come closer to you.

When you relax into your natural Well-Being, when you make statements such as,

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“I seek abundance, and I trust the Laws of the Universe. I’ve identified the things that I want and now I’m going to relax and allow them into my experience”,

&nbsp;

More of what you desire will come. If your financial situation feels like a struggle, you’re pushing your financial Well-Being further away. But when you begin to feel ease regarding your financial situation, you’re then allowing more abundance to flow into your experience. It really is as simple as that. And so, when you see others excelling in their attraction of money, and you feel negative emotion about it, that is your signal that you’re current thought is not allowing the abundance that you desire into your experience. When you find yourself critical of the way anyone has attracted or is

&nbsp;

Using money, you’re pushing money away from yourself. But when you realize that what others do with money has nothing to do with you, and that your primary work is to think and speak and do what feels good to you, then you’ll be in alignment not only about the subject of money, but about every important subject in your physical experience.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250029"></a>64.  Can we succeed without talent?

** **

Jerry: Abraham, what bearing does talent or skill or ability have on bringing abundance or money into our lives?

&nbsp;

Abraham: Very little. Those are all action aspects for the most part, and your action is responsible but for a miniscule part of what comes to you. Your thoughts and words (words are thoughts articulated) are the reason that your life unfolds as it does.

&nbsp;

Jerry: So then would you say that people with no salable skill or talent could still receive all the financial abundance they want in their lives?

&nbsp;

Abraham: Absolutely. Unless in comparing themselves to others and concluding that they have no salable skill or talent they feel diminished and therefore defeat their own experience with their own negative expectation.

&nbsp;

The most valuable skill that you could ever develop is the skill of directing your thoughts toward what you want, to be adept at quickly evaluating all situations and then quickly coming to the conclusion of what you most want, and then giving your undivided attention to that. There is tremendous skill in directing your own thoughts that will yield results that cannot be compared with results that mere action can provide.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250028"></a>65.   Can we get something without giving?

** **

Jerry: How can a person get passed the belief that they must give a dollar’s worth of something in order to get a dollar’s worth of something?

&nbsp;

Abraham: Your knowledge in all things comes only through life experience. But your life experience comes as a result of the thoughts that you’re thinking. So, even though you may have wanted something for a very long time, if your thoughts have been upon the absence of it, then it

&nbsp;

Could not come to you, and so from your personal experience you come to the conclusion that it’s not possible, or that it’s a struggle. In other words, you come to many valid conclusions about things being hard when you’ve lead a difficult life.

&nbsp;

It’s our desire to help you to understand what is really at the heart of that self-created struggle. We want to help you to begin from a different premise, and understand the Laws at the basis of all things. A new understanding of the Laws of the Universe and a willingness to begin telling a different story will give you different results. And those different results will then give you different beliefs, or knowledge.

&nbsp;

You are the one; you are the only one who can evaluate your effectiveness. No one else has the ability to discern where you stand relative to where you want to be. And no one else can decide where you should be. Only you.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250027"></a>66.   They want to win the lottery fortune

** **

Jerry: Many people are hoping for some major financial windfall to come to them to free them from debt or to release them from working at something they don’t want to work at in order to receive money. The thing I hear them say most often is that they want to win the lottery where they’ll get their abundance at exchange for someone else losing theirs.

&nbsp;

Abraham: If their expectation were in a place that would allow it, then that could be a way for money to come to them. But most know the odds against that, and so for most their expectation for winning the lottery is not in the powerful place either.

&nbsp;

Jerry: So, how does hoping to win relate to expecting to win?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Abraham: Well, just as hoping is more productive than doubting, expecting is much more productive than hoping.

&nbsp;

Jerry: Well then how could a person begin to expect something that their life experience hasn’t yet shown them? In other words, how can you expect something you haven’t experienced?

&nbsp;

Abraham: You do not have to have money to attract money. But you cannot feel poor and attract money. The key is, you have to find ways of improving the way you feel from right where you stand before things can begin to change. By softening your attention to the things that are going

&nbsp;

Wrong, and by beginning to tell stories that lean more in the direction of what you want instead of in the direction of what you’ve got, your vibration will shift, your point of attraction will shift, and you’ll get different results. And in a short time, because of the different results you’re then getting, you will then have beliefs, or knowledge, of abundance that will easily perpetuate more of the same. People often say, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And that’s why.

&nbsp;

Look for reasons to feel good, identify what you want, and hold your thoughts in a place that feels good.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250026"></a>67.  Living abundantly is not magic

** **

As we explain from our perspective the abundant nature of your Universe, and the potential for abundance that’s always available to you, we understand that our knowledge does not become your knowledge only because you hear us say it. If you asked you to trust what we say or just try to understand, you cannot just adopt our understanding as your own, for its only your own life experience that brings knowledge to you. The beliefs that you hold as a result of your own life experience are very strong. And we understand that you cannot release them immediately and replace them with others, even though we know that there are many more productive beliefs that you could foster. But there is something that you can begin today that will make a profound difference in the way your life unfolds, that does not require an immediate releasing of the beliefs that you currently hold – start telling a more positive better-feeling story about your life, and about the things that are important to you. Do not write your story like a factual document, weighing all the pros and cons of your experience. But instead tell the uplifting fanciful magical story of the wonder of your own life. And watch what happens. It will feel like magic as your life begins to transform right before your eyes. But it’s not by magic. It’s by the power of the Laws of the Universe and your deliberate alignment with those Laws.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250025"></a>68.  Trading freedom for money?

** **

Whether you’re focused upon the lack of money or the lack of time, you’re still focused upon the lack of something you want, and therefore holding yourself in resistance to the things you really want. Whether your negative emotion is because of your feeling of shortage of time, or whether it’s because of your feeling of shortage of money, you’re still feeling negative emotion, and you’re still in the state of resistance, and therefore you’re holding away what you really want.

&nbsp;

As you feel that you do not have enough time to do all of the things that you need or want to do, your attention to lack negatively impacts you much more than you realize. A feeling of being overwhelmed is your indicator that you’re denying yourself access to ideas, rendezvous, conditions and all manner of cooperation that could assist you if you were not disallowing them. It is an uncomfortable cycle where you feel a shortage of time, you focus upon your overloaded schedule, and then you feel overwhelmed, and in all of that you offer a vibration that makes improvement impossible. You have to begin telling a different story. You cannot continue to comment on how much you have to do without holding assistance away. There’s a cooperative Universe at your fingertips ready and able to help you in more ways than you can begin to imagine. But you deny yourself that benefit as you continue to complain about too much to do.

&nbsp;

As you feel that you do not have enough money, your attention to the lack of money disallows the avenues that could bring you more. You just cannot look at the opposite of what you want and get what you want. You have to begin telling a different story. You have to find a way to create a feeling of abundance before abundance can come.

&nbsp;

As you begin to feel free-err regarding the expenditure of time and money, doors will open, people will come to assist you, refreshing and productive ideas will occur to you, and circumstances and events will unfold. As you change the way you feel, you access the Energy that creates worlds. It’s there for your ready access at all times.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250024"></a>69.   Feeling negative with respect to dollars or cancer

** **

Jerry: Abraham, what’s the difference between having a negative feeling about money, and therefore you don’t get the money, and saying, “I don’t want cancer”, but you do get cancer?

&nbsp;

Abraham: Here’s the way it works – you get the essence of what you think about. And so, as you’re thinking about the lack of health, you’re getting the lack of health. As you’re thinking about the lack of money, you’re getting the lack of money. You can tell by the way you feel as you’re offering your thought whether you’re attracting the positive or the negative aspects of the subject. The Universe does not hear “No”. When you’re saying, “No, I do not want illness”, your attention to the subject of illness is saying, “Yes, come to me this thing I do not want”. Anything you’re giving your attention to is an invitation to the essence of it. When you’re saying, “I want money, but it will not come”, your attention to its absence is the same thing as saying, “Come to me, absence of money, which I do not want”.

&nbsp;

When you’re thinking of money in the way that will make it come to you, you always feel good. When you are thinking of money in the way that keeps it from coming to you, you always feel bad. That’s how you know the difference.

&nbsp;

So, you’re asking, “If I can get cancer by focusing upon the lack of health, then why couldn’t I get money by focusing upon the lack of it?” The receiving of money which you do want is the same as the receiving of health which you do want. The receiving of cancer which you do not want is the same as the receiving of no money which you do not want. Just make sure that whatever thoughts you’re thinking, or whatever words you’re speaking, evoke from you positive emotion. And then you’ll be in the mode of attracting what you do want. When negative emotion is present, you’re always in the mode of attracting something you do not want.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250023"></a>70.  He didn’t struggle for money

** **

Not long ago someone at a gathering was challenging LOA in a similar way as she told the story about her friend who had supported her former husband for many years. She explained how her friend had worked hard and taken care of him for all of that time and was often struggling to earn enough money to support them. Eventually she grew tired of his unwillingness to contribute financially, and they separated. Her husband never showed any evidence that money was important to him, but now, she tells us, he’s just inherited over a million dollars and now he won’t share his money with his ex-wife. “It doesn’t seem fair”, this woman said to us, “that his wife cared about money and worked hard for it and received so little, while he barely worked and didn’t seem to care about money at all, and now he’s inherited over a million dollars. How can that be?” she wanted to know.

We explained to her that understanding the LOA as we do, this story makes perfect sense. This woman worked hard and felt resentment, and was focused upon lack, and the Universe matched those feelings precisely. Her husband felt ease, refused to feel guilty, expected things to come to him easily, and the Universe matched those feelings precisely.

&nbsp;

Many believe that they must work hard and struggle and pay a price and feel pain and that they will then be rewarded for their struggle. But that is not consistent with the Laws of the Universe. You cannot find a happy ending to an unhappy journey. That defies Law.

&nbsp;

We told our friend, there is not a shred of evidence to the contrary of the LOA, and you had the benefit of knowing these two people, of seeing their attitudes and watching their results: one struggling, working hard, doing what society taught her to do, and not getting what she wants; while

&nbsp;

The other refused to struggle, insisted on a feeling of ease, and is the recipient of the resources that support more ease. Many would say, “Well, it might be consistent with the Laws of the Universe, but it’s still not right”.

&nbsp;

But we want you to know that when you get in sync with this powerful Law, you will then understand the absolute justice of it. Since you have control over what you offer, what could be more just than the Universe giving you exactly what you offer vibration ally? What could be more just than the powerful LOA responding equally to everyone who offers a vibration? Once you gain control over the thoughts you think, your sense of injustice will subside, and will be replaced with the exuberance for life and the zest to create that you were born with. Let everything in the Universe be an example to you of the way the Laws of the Universe work. If you believe that you must work hard in order to deserve the money that comes to you, then money cannot come to you unless you do work hard. But the money that comes in response to physical action is very small in comparison with what comes through alignment of thought.

&nbsp;

Surely you have noticed the enormous disparity between some people who apply tremendous action for little return while you see others seemingly offering very little action for an enormous return. We want you to understand that the disparity exists only in the comparison of the action they’re offering. But there is no disparity or injustice relative to the alignment of Energies within them.

&nbsp;

Financial success or any other kind of success does not require hard work or action. But it does require alignment of thought. You simply cannot offer negative thought about things that you desire and then make up for it with action or hard work. When you learn to direct your own thoughts, you will discover the true leverage of Energy alignment. Most of you are much closer to a financial fortune than you are even allowing yourself to purely desire. Because in the thought that it might come you right away begin thinking of how disappointed you will be if it does not come. And so, in your sacksful thought you do not allow yourself to desire or to expect anything magnificent in terms of money. And that’s the reason why for the most part you’re living rather mediocre financial experiences.

&nbsp;

You are right when you think money isn&#8217;t everything. You certainly do not need money to have joy in your experience. But in your society—where so much of what you live is tied to money in some way—most of you associate money with freedom. And since freedom is a basic tenet of your being, then coming into alignment with money will help you establish a balanced footing that will be of value to you in all other aspects of your experience.

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250022"></a>71.  Is spending money comfortable?

** **

A woman said to us one day, “I always feel uncomfortable when I spend money”. She told us that over time she’d managed to save quite a bit of money, but whenever she thought about spending any of it, she would freeze up and feel afraid to go another step further.

&nbsp;

We said to her, it is certainly understandable that when you believe that your money is coming to you because of the action that you’re offering, and you also believe that you will not always be able to offer the action, that you would want to hold on to your money and spend it sparingly to make it last. However, that feeling of shortage slows the process of more money flowing into your experience. If you feel uncomfortable with the idea of spending money, then we absolutely do not encourage you to spend the money while you’re feeling uncomfortable. Because any action taken during negative emotion is never a good idea. But the reason for your discomfort is not about the action of spending the money, but instead it’s an indication that your thoughts about money in that moment are not a vibrational match to your own desire.

&nbsp;

A belief in shortage will never resonate with your broader knowing, because there is no shortage. Any attention to lack of something wanted will always produce negative emotion within you because your guidance is letting you know that you have strayed from your broader basic understanding of abundance and of Well-Being. Find a way to ease your discomfort and eventually transform it into a feeling hope, and then into positive expectation. And then from that stable place of feeling better that feeling of freezing up will be replaced with confidence and enthusiasm.

&nbsp;

Whether you are focused upon the shortage of money—or seeing yourself as having only so many years to live (and so each day that is expended is one day closer to the end of your years)—that feeling of decline is contrary to your broader understanding of the Eternal nature of your Being. In the same way that you understand that you do not have to attempt the impossible task of drawing enough air into your lungs to last all day or all week or all year, but instead you easily breathe in and out, always receiving what you want or need whenever you want or need it, money can flow in and out of your experience with the same ease, once you achieve that expectation of eternal abundance. All of the money that you want is available for you to receive. All you have to do is allow it into your experience. And as the money flows in, you can gently allow it to flow out. For like the air you breathe, there will always be more to flow. You do not have to guard your money, like holding your breathe and not letting it out because there will not be any more coming. More is coming.

&nbsp;

People sometimes protest as they tell their stories of shortage or scarcity, pointing out the reality of the shortage that they’ve experienced or witnessed or heard about. And we understand that there are plenty of examples to point to, of people who are experiencing shortages of many things that they desire.

&nbsp;

But we want you to understand that those experiences of shortage are not because abundance is not available. But instead because it is being disallowed. Continuing to tell stories of shortage only continues to contradict your desire for abundance. And you cannot have it both ways. You cannot focus on unwanted and receive wanted. You cannot focus upon stories about money that make you feel uncomfortable and allow into your experience what makes you feel comfortable. You have to begin telling a different story if you want different results. We would begin by saying,

&nbsp;

“I want to feel good. I want to feel productive and expansive. My thoughts are the basis for the attraction of all things that I consider to be good, which includes enough money for my comfort and joy, which includes health and wonderful people around me who are stimulating and uplifting and exciting”.

&nbsp;

Begin telling the story of your desire and then add to it the details of the positive aspects that you can find that match those desires. And then embellish your positive expectation by speculating with your good-feeling wouldn’t it be nice if . . . ? Examples. Say things like:

&nbsp;

“Only good things come to me. . . While I don’t have all of the answers, and while I don’t know all of the steps, and I can’t identify all of the doors that will open for me, I know that as I move through time and space, the path will become obvious to me. I know I will be able to figure it out as I go along.”

&nbsp;

Every time you tell your better-feeling story, you will feel better and the details of your life will improve. The better it gets, the better it gets.

### <a name="_TOC_250021"></a>72.  How to change my point of attraction?

** **

Sometimes people worry that they’ve been telling the story of what they do not want for such a long time that they now do not have time left in their life to make up for all those years of focusing upon the shortage of money. They have no cause for worry. Although it is true that you cannot go backward and undo all of that negative thinking, there is no reason to do that even if you could, because all of your power is in your now. As you find a better-feeling thought right now, your point

&nbsp;

Of attraction shifts now. The only reason that it may seem like negative thinking that you’ve picked up many years ago is having an impact on your life now is because you have been continuing the negative train of thought or beliefs through all of those years. A belief is only a thought you continue to think. A belief is nothing more than a chronic pattern of thought, and you have the ability, if you try a little bit, to begin a new pattern, to tell a new story, to achieve a different vibration, to change your point of attraction. Just a simple act of noticing how many things you could purchase in this one day with 100 dollars you’re carrying with you would dramatically alter your financial point of attraction. That one simple process is enough to tip the balance of your vibrational scale, enough to show you actual tangible results in your attraction of money.

&nbsp;

Mentally spend your money and imagine an improved lifestyle. Deliberately conjure a feeling of freedom by imagining what it would feel like to have a large amount of money at your disposal. You see, the LOA is responding to your vibration, not to the reality you’re currently living. But if your vibration continues to be only about the reality you are living, nothing can change. You can easily change your point of attraction by visualizing the lifestyle you desire and holding your attention upon those images until you begin to feel relief, which is an indicator that a true vibrational shift has occurred.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250020"></a>73.  My standards are mine to set

** **

Sometimes from an awareness of shortage of money you think that you want everything that you see. A sort of uncontrollable craving rises within you, which tortures you when you do not have the money to spend, or causes even more distress when you give into the cravings and spend money you do not have, going deeper into debt. But that craving to spend money under those conditions is really a false signal. For it’s not coming from a real desire to have those things. Buying one more thing and bringing it home will not satisfy that craving. For what you’re really feeling is a void that can only be filled by coming into vibrational alignment with who-you-really-are.

You’re currently feeling insecure, when who-you-really-are is someone who is absolutely secure. You’re currently feeling inadequate, when who-you-really-are is someone who is adequate.

You’re feeling lack, when who-you-really-are is someone who is abundant.

It is a vibrational shift that you’re craving, not the ability to purchase something.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Once you’re able to achieve and consistently maintain your personal alignment, a great deal of money will flow into your experience, if that is your desire. And you will very likely spend large amounts of money on things that you desire. But your purchases will feel very different to you then. You will not feel a need or a void that you’re attempting to fill with that purchase, but instead you

&nbsp;

Will feel a satisfying interest in something, which will easily make its way into your experience. And every part of the process – from the inception of the idea to the full blown manifestation of it in your experience – will bring you a feeling of satisfaction and joy.

&nbsp;

Do not let others set the standards about how much money you should have or about what you should do with it, for you are the only one who could ever accurately define that. Come into alignment with who-you-really-are and allow the things that life has helped you to know that you want to flow into your experience.

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250019"></a>74.  Does saving for security work?

** **

A man related to us that he once had a teacher who told him that to set money aside for security was the same as planning for a disaster. And that, I fact, the very act of trying to feel more secure would actually lead to more insecurity, because it would attract the unwanted disaster. He wanted to know if that philosophy fit in with our teachings about the LOA.

We told him that teacher was right in pointing out that attention to anything brings more of the essence of it to you. And so, if you were to focus upon the idea of possible bad things looming out there in your future, the discomfort that you would feel as you pondered those unwanted things would be your indication that you are indeed in the process of attracting them. But it is absolutely possible to briefly consider something unwanted occurring in the future, such as a financial situation that makes you feel insecure as you consider it, which could cause you to then consider the financial stability that you desire. As you focus upon the security that you desire, you may very well be inspired to an action that enhances that state of security. The action of saving money or investing in assets in and of itself is neither positive nor negative. But that teacher would be correct to say that you cannot get to a place of security from an insecure footing.

&nbsp;

Our encouragement is to use the power of your mind to focus upon the good-feeling security you seek, and then take whatever positive action that’s inspired from that place of feeling good. Anything that feels good to you is in harmony with what you want. Anything that feels bad to you is not in harmony with what you want. It is truly as simple as that.

&nbsp;

Some say that you should not want money at all, because the desire for money is materialistic and not spiritual. But we want you to remember that you are here in this very physical world, where spirit has materialized. You’re here in your very physical bodies on this very physical planet, where that which is spirit and that, which is physical, or material, blend. You cannot separate yourself from the aspect of yourself that is spiritual. And while you are here in these bodies, you cannot separate

&nbsp;

Yourself from that which is physical, or material. All of the magnificent things of a physical nature, that are surrounding you, are spiritual in nature.

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250018"></a>75.  Telling a new story about abundance, money and financial Well-Being

** **

The LOA is not responding to the reality that you’re currently living and perpetuating. But instead it is responding to the vibrational patterns of thoughts that are emanating from you. So, as you begin to tell the story of who-you-are in relationship to money from your perspective of what you desire, rather than from the perspective of what you’re actually currently living, your patterns of thought will shift, and so will your point of attraction. What-is has no bearing on what is coming, unless you’re continually regurgitating the story of what-is. By thinking and speaking more of how you really want your life to be, you allow what you’re currently living to be the jumping off place for so much more. But if you speak predominantly of what-is, then you still jump off, but you jump off into more of the same.

&nbsp;

So, consider the following questions, letting your natural answers flow in response to them. And then hear some examples of what your new story regarding money might sound like. And then begin to tell your own new and improved story of your financial picture and watch how quickly and surely circumstances and events will begin to move around you to make your new story a reality.

&nbsp;

Do you have as much money in your life experience as you want right now? Is the Universe abundant?

Do you have the option of having plenty of money?

Was the amount of money that you would receive in this lifetime already decided before you were born?

Are you now setting into motion through the power of your current thought the amount of money that will flow?

Do you have the ability to change your financial situation? Are you in control of your financial condition?

Do you want more money?

Knowing what you now know, is financial abundance guaranteed?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250017"></a>76.  An example of my “old” story about money

** **

Here’s an example of an “old” story about money:

&nbsp;

“There are so many things that I want that I just can’t afford. I’m making more money today than ever before, but money feels as tight as ever, it just seems like I can’t get ahead. It seems like I’ve worried about money my whole life. I remember how hard my parents worked, and my mother’s constant worry about money, and I guess I inherited all of that. But that isn’t the kind of inheritance I’d hope for. I know there are really wealthy people in the world who don’t have to worry about money, but they aren’t anywhere near me. Everyone I know right now is struggling and worried about what’s going to happen next”.

&nbsp;

Notice how this story began by noticing a current unwanted condition, and then moved to justification of the situation,  and then looked into the past for more emphasis of the current problem, which amplified the resentment more, then moved on to a broader view of perceived shortage. In other words, when you begin to tell a negative story, the LOA will help you reach from your present perspective into your past, even into your future, but the same vibrational pattern of lack will persist.

&nbsp;

When you focus upon lack in an attitude of complaining, you establish a vibrational point of attraction that then gives you access only to more thoughts of complaint, whether you’re focused in your present, your past or your future. Your deliberate effort to tell a new story will change that. Your new story will establish a new pattern of thought, providing you with a new point of attraction from your present, about your past and into your future. The simple effort of looking for positive aspects from right where you stand will set a new vibrational tone that will not only effect the way you feel right now, but will begin the immediate attraction of thoughts, people, circumstances and things that are pleasing to you.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### <a name="_TOC_250016"></a>77.  An example of my “new” story about money

** **

Here’s an example of a “new” story about money:

&nbsp;

“I like the idea that money is as available as the air I breathe. I like the idea of breathing in and breathing out more money. It’s fun to imagine a lot of money flowing to me. I can see how my feeling about money affects the money that comes to me. I am happy to understand that with practice I can control my attitude about money or about anything. I notice that the more I tell my story of abundance, the better I feel. I like knowing that I am the creator of my own reality, and that the money that flows into my experience is directly related to my thoughts. I like knowing that I can adjust the amount of money that I receive by adjusting my thoughts. Now that I understand the formula for creating, now that I understand that I do get the essence of what I think about, and most

&nbsp;

important, now that I understand that I can tell by the way I’m feeling whether I’m focused upon money or lack of money, I feel confident that in time I will align my thoughts with abundance and money will flow powerfully into my experience. I understand that the people around me hold many different perspectives about money, about wealth, about spending, saving, philanthropy, giving money, receiving money, earning money and so forth, and it’s not necessary for me to understand their opinions or experiences. I’m relieved to know that I do not have to sort all of that out. It is very nice to know that my only work is to align my own thoughts about money with my own desires about money, and that whenever I’m feeling good, I’ve found that alignment. I like knowing that it’s alright for me to occasionally feel negative emotion regarding money. But it is my intention to quickly direct my thoughts in better-feeling directions, because it’s logical to me that thoughts that feel good when I think them will bring positive results. I understand that money will not necessarily manifest instantly in my experience with the changing of my thinking, but I do expect to see steady improvement as a result of my deliberate effort to think better-feeling thoughts. The first evidence of my alignment with money will be my improved feeling, my improved mood, and my improved attitude. And then real changes in my financial situation will be soon to follow. I’m certain about that. I am aware of the absolute correlation between what I’ve been thinking and feeling about money, and what is actually happening in my life experience. I can see the evidence of the LOA’s absolute and unerring response to my thought, and I look forward to more evidence in response to my improved thoughts. I can feel a powerful leveraging of Energy in being more deliberate about my thoughts. I believe that at many levels I’ve always known this, and it feels good to return to my core beliefs about my power and value and worthiness. I am living a very abundant life, and it feels so good to realize that whatever this life experience causes me to desire, I can achieve that. I love knowing that I am unlimited. I feel tremendous relief in recognizing that I do not have to wait for money or things to materialize before I can feel better. And I now understand that when I do feel better, the things and experiences and money that I want must come. As easily as air flows in and out of my being, so it is with money. My desire draws it in, and my ease of thought lets it flow out. In and out&#8230; in and out&#8230; ever flowing&#8230; always easy&#8230; whatever I desire&#8230; whenever I desire&#8230; as much as I desire&#8230; in and out&#8230;”

&nbsp;

There is no right or wrong way to tell your improved story. It can be about your past, present or future experiences. The only criterion that’s important is that you be conscious of your intent to tell a better-feeling improved version of your story. Telling many good-feeling short stories through your day will change your point of attraction. Just remember that the story you tell is the basis of your life. So tell it the way you want it to be.
