<span style="font-family:Verdana;">General-purpose vs. application-oriented packages<br />Traditionally: simulation languages and simulators<br />Languages were flexible but required programming, simulators were easy to use but not very flexible<br />Now, almost all simulation software uses graphical interface so is relatively easy to use, learn<br />Distinction now is between general-purpose simulation software and applications-oriented package<br />Specific applications include manufacturing, call centers, telecommunications, etc.</p>
