**Are you more like a One with a Nine-wing or a One with a Two-wing? Read below to**  
**find out.**

## Type One with a Nine Wing (1w9)

**Positive:**

• Highly Discerning, Wise  
• Scholarly, Erudite (5-like)  
• Emotionally reserved  
• Very idealistic, Prefer being alone  
• Otherworldly yet Logical  
• Objective, Moderate, Relaxed  
• Easy-going, Calm, Balanced

**Negative:**

• Detached, Stiff, Stubborn  
• Remote, Cool, Impersonal

**Type One with a Nine-Wing:** Ones with a Nine-wing (1w9s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Nines than of Twos (the other wing), although both wings (9 and 2) can influence  
their personality. 1w9s tend to be more calm, composed, dispassionate and moderate than  
1w2s. They can be scholarly and somewhat impersonal or detached emotionally like Fives.  
They are usually more objective, philosophical, otherworldly and emotionally reserved than 1w2s  
but are still kind, considerate and caring of others. Like 1w2s, they too are idealistic and want to  
improve themselves and the world around them but they tend to work by themselves much of the  
time as opposed to with people on the front lines (with the possible exception of social subtypes  
who can be a little more openly moralizing). They like to teach and explain their views calmly but  
resolutely rather than debating with people or passionately raising their voice to persuade others  
to change. They also tend to love animals and nature because of their naturalness, simplicity and  
purity. This subtype is gentler and less likely to show anger overtly than 1w2s.

Negatively, 1w9s can be too idealistic and have perfectionistic expectations of others that  
are not humanly possible to live up to. They can appear to be too impersonal, cold, remote and  
stubborn – focused more on their ideals than on individual people. At their worst, they can be  
disdainful, contemptuous, condescending and seemingly elitist – “People are just too ignorant,  
immoral, undisciplined, profligate and hedonistic for their own good. When will they ever learn?”  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type One with a Two-wing also (see  
below). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions.  
See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference  
might be.

## Type One with a Two Wing (1w2)

**Positive:**

• Principled yet Empathetic  
• More Interpersonal than 1w9  
• Like working with others and are sensitive to their needs  
• Helpful, Compassionate, Warm  
• Vocal, Emotionally Passionate  
• Humanistic, Personal quality

**Negative:**

• Fiery, Critical, Image-conscious  
• Controlling, Frustrated, Irritable

**Type One with a Two-Wing:** Ones with a Two-wing (1w2s) tend to take on more of the  
attributes of Twos than of Nines (the other wing), although both wings (2 and 9) can influence  
their personality. 1w2s tend to be more empathetic, compassionate, warm and overtly helpful  
than 1w9s. Like 1w9s, they are genuinely interested in improving the world and especially  
helping people. They are more willing to get passionately, hands-on involved to bring about the  
changes and reforms that are important to them. They are sensitive to others needs and willingly  
sacrifice their time and energy to be of assistance to people. Their high standards are nicely  
tempered by humanitarianism and altruism. They are more zealous than 1w9s and can be quite  
vocal and persuasive, getting others fired up to join their mission or cause. As Ones, most 1w2s  
need their alone time but they are more interpersonal and energized by engaging with others  
than 1w9s. Some 1w2s like to get involved in politics (especially social or sexual 1w2s) since  
they have strong opinions about how to improve conditions for people, are good at debating and  
have a strong desire to make a big difference with their life in service of others.  
Negatively, 1w2s can be image conscious, emotionally volatile and attention seeking  
(especially sexual 1w2s). They can also be rather authoritarian, controlling and self-righteous.  
They can easily get frustrated with people when things aren’t working out the way they think they  
“should.” They can become critical, touchy, emotional and outspoken about their discontents. At  
their worst, 1w2s can become aggressive, hypocritical and volatile. They can develop  
dependency in their relationships and conveniently overlook inconsistencies in their own behavior.  
This wing is prevalent in sexual Ones (see the sub-types section next) although it can appear  
in any of the three subtypes.  
You may find that you can relate to the description of Type One with a Nine-wing also (see  
above). However, there is a fundamental energetic difference between these two descriptions.  
See if you can discern which description sounds more like you, however slight that difference  
might be.
