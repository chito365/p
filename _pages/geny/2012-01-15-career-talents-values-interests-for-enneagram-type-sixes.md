Richard Nixon and Marilyn Monroe are two famous Enneagram Sixes but look how different  
they are based on other systems (click on the links below to see what I mean):

**So, what DO Richard Nixon and Marilyn Monroe have in common, both  
being Enneagram type Sixes?** 

All Sixes are motivated by the need to feel safe and secure in their life. They  
subconsciously scan for danger and any potential threat to their safety and well-being. They tend  
to be fearful and like to anticipate where trouble or danger might arise. Some Sixes are “phobic”  
and seem overtly nervous and restless. They use charm and friendliness (and sometimes  
seductiveness) as a way to win people to their side so that they won’t be a threat. Other Sixes  
are “counterphobic” and hide their inner anxiety and intense emotions from others. When fear  
arises in them they confront the fearful situation head-on rather than trying to charm someone  
into liking them. Counterphobic Sixes can be touchy, defensive and even explosively reactive  
when stressed and provoked. Both phobic and counterphobic Sixes are preoccupied with their  
need for safety and security. They tend to imagine worst-case scenarios. Some can even be a  
little paranoid. Sixes can exhibit a phobic or counterphobic response to danger (being nice or  
confronting) at different times but usually have a predominant mode. Doesn’t that sound like  
both Richard Nixon and Marilyn Monroe?  
Sixes can have either a Five wing or a Seven wing. Richard Nixon is a Six with a Five  
wing and Marilyn Monroe is a Six with a Seven wing. If, after clicking on the previous links,  
you feel that you are more of a Six with a strong Five wing, look at what Enneagram type Fives  
need for career satisfaction as well. If you feel you are more of a Six with a strong Seven wing,  
look at what Enneagram type Sevens need for career satisfaction as well.  
**Average to unhealthy Sixes** tend to doubt their own thinking and inner guidance.  
Lacking confidence in themselves, average to unhealthy Sixes tend to choose safe jobs that don’t  
necessarily fulfill their heart’s desire but do offer them stability, security and predictability in their life (they hope). Wanting to be reliable, dependable and trustworthy, average to unhealthy Sixes  
can easily take on too many commitments and then feel overwhelmed and pressured to follow  
through with all of them. Unhealthy Sixes can sometimes have problems keeping a job if they  
are too testy, defensive, suspicious of others’ motives and reactionary. If you are or know  
someone who is an average to unhealthy Six that would like to change careers but is  
overwhelmed at the thought of making a change then I highly recommend the book, “The  
Career Coward’s Guide to Changing Careers” by Katy Piotrowski, M.Ed.  
Healthy Sixes are engaging, friendly, hard-working and trust their own inner guidance.  
They are self-reliant yet interdependent, cooperative and supportive. They have faith in  
themselves, people and life. Some are courageous, inspiring leaders. Examples of healthy Sixes  
are J. Krishnamurti, Byron Katie, Robert F. Kennedy, Robert Redford, Woody Allen,  
Sherlock Holmes, Groucho Marx, Jay Leno, Johnny Carson and Billy Graham.
