    <span data-offset-key="657ed-0-0">Clarification:</span><span data-offset-key="657ed-0-1"> Ti involves clarifying definitions to get more precision. This often involves finding just the right word to clearly express an idea concisely, crisply, and to the point. Using Ti is like having an internal sense of the essential qualities of something, noticing the fine distinctions that make it what it is and then naming it. </span>

    <span data-offset-key="e2nq9-0-0">Principle Understanding:</span><span data-offset-key="e2nq9-0-1"> Ti involves figuring out the principles on which something works and then evaluating according to these principles and whether something fits the framework or model. Ti ponders the apparent chaos of the world in order to extract from it the universal truths and principles that can be counted on. These principles, once extracted, will provide the logical structure on which to build strategies. </span>

    <span data-offset-key="9i25o-0-0">Situational Logic:</span><span data-offset-key="9i25o-0-1"> Ti is not conceptual and linear. It’s body based and holistic, and it operates by way of visual, tactile, or spatial cues, inclining us to reason experientially rather than analytically. Ti, with its all-at-once approach to life, doesn’t require exact predictability before it takes action. Its decisions are based on the probabilities and it leaves room for the random and unexpected. Ti uses hands-on experience to recognize, in the midst of action, which variables are best taken into account and which are irrelevant to our goal. Thus, Ti always involves perceptual skills. Ti is not just a matter of responding to immediate perceptual stimuli. It’s a decision-making process. When one is thinking in an introverted way, they are coordinating their behaviors with the variables in a situation related to our intended effect. Ti helps to understand what it means to be I harmony with the parts of a situation that are still in flux. When we’re involved in something that interests us, we don’t distinguish our thoughts form the tacit level of information we’re relying on. We’re part of the process, changing its nature by changing ourselves. </span>

    <span data-offset-key="4dv2c-0-0">Dispassion:</span><span data-offset-key="4dv2c-0-1"> Ti types are usually level-headed, objective, impersonal, yet intensely involved in problem solving. They are rigorous with their thoughts and analysis, choosing the exact words that convey precisely what is meant. Ti types maintain the utmost objectivity. They approach people and events as dispassionate observers, with the goal of arriving at the most comprehensive truth possible. Ti types typically do not take constructive criticism and disagreement personally. They often welcome tough, unrelenting critique as an aid to achieving the highest levels of accuracy and objectivity. </span>

    <span data-offset-key="b89s9-0-0">Situational Analysis:</span><span data-offset-key="b89s9-0-1"> Ti is analyzing and categorizing; this involves an internal reasoning process of deriving subcategories of classes and sub-principles of general principles. These can then be used in problem solving, analysis, and refining of a product or an idea. This process is evidenced in behaviors like taking things or ideas apart to figure out how they work. The analysis also involves looking at different sides of an issue and seeing where there is inconsistency. In so doing, we search for a “leverage point” that will fix problem with the least amount of effort or damage to the system. We engage in this process when we notice logical inconsistencies between statements and frameworks, using a model to analyze situations, find root causes and foresee consequences. They are curious and capable of explaining complex political, economical or technological problems, Taking great pleasure in explaining all the factors and intricacies. </span>

While one must withdraw and be dispassionate of the feelings of others in order to use their subjective personal logic, Fe ignores the personal one’s personal logic and focuses on the feelings and needs of others. </span>
