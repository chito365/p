Relationship of mutual correction. Mirror  
partners have similar interests and ideas, but  
a slightly different understanding of the same  
problems. Each partner see different halves of  
the same problem thus partners find what the  
other partner is thinking interesting. The area  
of confidence of one partner is the area of  
creativity for the other partner. Mirror  
partners can be involved in really hot disputes  
and can even come to blows in the name of  
their opinion. However, Mirror partners are  
often very good friends. When they work  
together on the same project, their mutual  
correction and adjustment becomes a  
constructive criticism that is usually accepted  
as useful. Generally agree about setting near  
future goals, but disagree about global aims.
