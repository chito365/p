    When and How Did Muhammad Ali Die?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Muhammad Ali passed away on June 3, 2016, in Phoenix, Arizona after being hospitalized for what was reportedly a respiratory issue. The boxing legend had been suffering from Parkinson’s disease and had in recent years undergone surgery for spinal stenosis. In early 2015, the athlete battled pneumonia and was hospitalized for a severe urinary tract infection.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Wife and Children
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Ali was married four times and had nine children, including two children he fathered outside of marriage. Ali married his first wife, Sonji Roi, in 1964; they divorced after one year when she refused to adopt the Nation of Islam dress and customs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ali married his second wife, 17-year-old Belinda Boyd, in 1967. Boyd and Ali had four children together: Maryum, born in 1969; Jamillah and Liban, both born in 1970; and Muhammad Ali Jr.; born in 1972. Boyd and Ali divorced in 1976.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At the same time Ali was married to Boyd, he traveled openly with Veronica Porche, who became his third wife in 1977. The pair had two daughters together, including Laila Ali, who followed in Ali’s footsteps by becoming a champion boxer. Porche and Ali divorced in 1986.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Muhammad Ali’s net worth was estimated at $80 million before his death in 2016, according to Celebrity Net Worth. In 2005, Ali sold the rights to his name and image to Robert Sillerman (“American Idol”) for $50 million for 20 percent interest in the business. Sillerman called the company G.O.A.T. in honor of Ali’s nickname, Greatest of All Time. Ali also took in millions from his endorsement deals with companies including Adidas and Electronic Arts.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Ali’s Famous Fights
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Often referring to himself as &#8220;the greatest,&#8221; Ali was not afraid to sing his own praises. He was known for boasting about his skills before a fight and for his colorful descriptions and phrases. In one of his more famously quoted descriptions, Ali told reporters that he could &#8220;float like a butterfly, sting like a bee&#8221; in the boxing ring. A few of his more well-known matches include the following:
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Sonny Liston
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    After winning gold at the 1960 Olympics, Ali took out British heavyweight champion Henry Cooper in 1963. He then knocked out Sonny Liston in 1964 to become the heavyweight champion of the world.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Joe Frazier
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    In 1971, Muhammad Ali took on Joe Frazier in what has been called the &#8220;Fight of the Century.&#8221; Frazier and Ali went toe-to-toe for 14 rounds before Frazier dropped Ali with a vicious left hook in the 15th. Ali recovered quickly, but the judges awarded the decision to Frazier, handing Ali his first professional loss after 31 wins. After suffering a loss to Ken Norton, Ali beat Frazier in a 1974 rematch.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In 1975, Ali and Frazier locked horns again for their grudge match in Quezon City, Philippines. Dubbed the &#8220;Thrilla in Manila,&#8221; the bout nearly went the distance, with both men delivering and absorbing tremendous punishment. However, Frazier&#8217;s trainer threw in the towel after the 14th round, giving the hard-fought victory to Ali.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    George Foreman
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Another legendary Ali fight took place in 1974 against undefeated heavyweight champion George Foreman. Billed as the &#8220;Rumble in the Jungle,&#8221; the bout was organized by promoter Don King and held in Kinshasa, Zaire. For once, Ali was seen as the underdog to the younger, massive Foreman, but he silenced his critics with a masterful performance. He baited Foreman into throwing wild punches with his &#8220;rope-a-dope&#8221; technique, before stunning his opponent with an eighth-round knockout to reclaim the heavyweight title.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Leon Spinks
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    After losing his title to Leon Spinks in February 1978, Muhammad Ali defeated him in a September 1978 rematch, becoming the first boxer to win the heavyweight championship three times.
