1. Have a VISION of what you want to be. Never dream to be a Mentor and end up being a Terrorist.

2. You should know:- a) what is required for you to achieve? b) what&#8217;s all about your background; never forget your poor background when you become rich.

3. You should accept the outcome or the results of anything you do. Whether good or bad.

4. Have the mental attitude of a successful person. This is achieved by having mentors in life who have achieved in your desired field, for instance Bill Gates, Robert Kiyosaki, Bob Marley, Shiv Khera among others.

5. Be realistic &#8211; know where you are, what are you doing and why are you doing.

6. Develop a bookwarm mentality, that is, like what you do always.

7. Learn or know every detail of what you do daily.

8. Determine your power over others by being self disciple.

9. Work as a team. Know your working team(s), together each achieve success. TEAMS. T ~ Together, E ~ Each, A ~ Achieve, M ~ More, S ~ Success.

10. Take your physical health seriously. This is achieved by working up to 6-8 hrs a day. Remember your God.
