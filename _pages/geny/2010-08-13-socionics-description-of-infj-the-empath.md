<span style="font-family: 'andale mono', monospace;"><b>Ethical-Intuitive Intratim &#8211; INFj (The Empath)</b>&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-family: 'andale mono', monospace;"><i>Based upon original work by Victor Gulenko with some alterations</i>&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'andale mono', monospace;"><a class="active-text" title="More about INFjs" href="https://www.afriqueunique.org/portrait-of-an-infj-introverted-intuitive-feeling-judging-introverted-intuition-with-extraverted-feeling/">INFjs<img src="http://www.socionics.com/prof/common/graph/q-mark.gif" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;have a very characteristic dispassionate facial expression. This is often reminiscent of the depiction of saints and martyrs from early Christian icons. Their faces convey the feeling that their soul is suffering even when it is not. INFjs faces are often perfect ovals but can be rectangular in shape as well. Their noses are usually straight and slightly elongated, but not prominent.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'andale mono', monospace;">INFjs do not show intense positive emotions, instead they simply smile. All their facial expressions openly reproach nefarious happenings. The same can be noticed in their intonation. In many cases INFjs have a slim, ascetic figure. Their movements are often quite harsh although not lacking mobility. INFjs with more fuller figures are less mobile and active. When walking, INFjs may keep their feet close and parallel to the ground, maintaining a short distance between each step.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'andale mono', monospace;">INFjs are generally very modest, which is also noticeable in their choice of clothes. However from time to time they may wear something very flashy according to the latest fashion especially is noticeable in males. INFjs prefer to observe people for sometime before making contact in order to identify social hierarchy in a group. Normally INFjs do not show initiative when making contact for the first time.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'andale mono', monospace;">INFjs can be very touchy and this may strain the easy atmosphere of a conversation. Sometimes they adopt a monotone speech pattern that can snuff out all playfulness in others. INFjs have a special ability to listen to people and as a result they are often asked for advice or sympathy. They never push people away and are always prepared to listen for as long as it takes to make others feel better, even if they theoretically have better things to do. INFjs are always ready to help friends in difficult life situations. They care not with words but with real actions.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'andale mono', monospace;">INFjs do not really make good cheats or frauds. This however, does not stop them from trying sometimes. And even if they do, they are likely to feel pretty bad about themselves afterwards. This gives INFjs a reputation as naive and impractical people. INFjs are very conscientious in their work . They do everything carefully, paying great attention to the quality of their labour. INFjs demand cleanliness and order. At home they tend to keep everything tidy, carefully storing their belonging, especially females INFjs. They like a calm and measured style of life and therefore try to prepare and anticipate everything beforehand, often making them quite reliable.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-family: 'andale mono', monospace;">INFjs know how to establish peace between conflicting sides. They take a neutral position in the conflict, often being fired upon from both sides. They rarely push, shout or show aggressiveness. Instead they punish offenders by completely ignoring them until they realise their mistakes and apologise. INFjs do not like to project themselves: when everybody works, they work too, when everybody rests, they rest too. INFjs often cannot stand violence, conflict and graphic depiction of injuries.&nbsp;</span>
