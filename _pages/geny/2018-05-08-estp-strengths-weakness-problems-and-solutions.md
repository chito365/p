<u>What does Success mean to an ESTP?</u>

With a dominant function of Extraverted Sensing, and an auxiliary function of Introverted Thinking, people with the ESTP personality type have a heightened need for sensory experience and for tactile engagement with their physical environment. &nbsp;The ESTP is most comfortable when they can treat life as a big game in which they must be quick to use their skills in order to win. In such a game-playing scenario, the ESTP is most likely to be the winner, as no other personality type is as quick on their feet as the ESTP.

&nbsp;

ESTP’s have an amazingly ability to size up people in an instant and come up with an accurate ballpark understanding of where they are coming from. The ESTP cannot help using this skill, it is natural for them, but it brings them great satisfaction to be able to use this skill to enact some personal gain, or to “win the game.” The ESTP is also strongly driven to tangibly interact with their immediate physical environment. This need manifests itself in many ways, most commonly as an attraction to sports or physical challenges, and as a desire to always be doing something. &nbsp;ESTP’s are the great Doers. &nbsp;If you want to make something happen quickly, ask an ESTP. These inherent skills make the ESTP likely to find success professionally as salespeople or professional athletes. &nbsp;However, any career that capitalizes on their people skills or their ability to maneuver within their physical world AND gives them immediate feedback is likely to be a good fit for the ESTP.

&nbsp;

The ESTP’s need to be engaged with their immediate, external world makes success on a personal level more challenging. They feel happiest when they are outside of themselves, but personal success requires going within to get to know the self. &nbsp;However, once these needs are recognized, they are not mutually exclusive. &nbsp;The ESTP who feeds their constant drive for new sensory experiences as well as their need for real reflection upon those experiences and impressions will find a deeper level of personal satisfaction than the ESTP who allows his immediate needs for sensory experiences to yank him about.

&nbsp;

However, even those ESTP’s who have developed their ability to reflect on matters will always be connected at some base level to the strong desire for new experiences, and will get their “bread and butter” feelings of success from conquering challenges in their physical environment. ESTP’s need to know they’ve got the goods, won the moment, done the job. Once given a task that intrigues them, or having discovered something new to be tried, very little will stop them from doing all they can to meet the challenge, and thereby achieve what they consider to be a personal success. &nbsp;Success to an ESTP is usually not measured in ongoing terms, but in transient moments of achievement, moments which bring the ESTP the needed feeling of having won the day.

&nbsp;

<u>Allowing Your ESTP Strengths to Flourish</u>

As an ESTP, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren&#8217;t natural strengths for other types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more readily see your place in the world, and be more content with your role.

&nbsp;

Nearly all ESTP’s will recognize the following characteristics in themselves. They should embrace and nourish these strengths:

  * A great talent for reading people and knowing “where they’re at” by just watching their behavior and
  * The ability to draw upon an extremely detailed and ready knowledge of the physical world around them at a moment’s
  * A competitive flair which drives them to win out in difficult ESTP’s love to have the odds stacked against them, which makes them great troubleshooters or the type of salespeople who can cold canvass a winning deal from the hardest client.
  * A mental toughness which makes them extremely hard to In any contest, the ESTP will almost always be the last man standing.
  * A strong, “get after it” mentality that causes them to get things
  * ESTP’s who have developed their Introverted Thinking to the extent that they consider what their perceptions mean to them and discriminate carefully between the options available rather than simply flowing with the process of the moment, will enjoy these very special gifts:
  * The ability to recognize when others are uncomfortable or in trouble and deal with their
  * The ability to realize that there is value in meeting other people’s needs in a real
  * An understanding that other people may have a different perspective on life, and those other perspectives may be useful and
  * An ability to make the most of their winning capabilities over a long
  * A special talent for showing others how to make the most of Such ESTP’s can be extraordinary teachers of positive life skills.
  * A knack for showing not only how certain things can be done, but how they can be done in a far more valuable or efficient Such ESTP’s are an asset to any company involved in manufacturing.
  * A skill for understanding the behavior of people and predicting ESTP’s can make very good detectives or analysts.

&nbsp;

<u>Potential Problem Areas</u>

With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without &#8220;bad&#8221;, there would be no &#8220;good&#8221;. Without &#8220;difficult&#8221;, there would be no &#8220;easy&#8221;. We value our strengths, but we often curse or simply ignore our weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must certainly exploit our strengths, but we must also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at the potential problem areas in our personality type.

&nbsp;

It is important to realize that type weaknesses are just the blind spots behind our stronger character traits, and that the more undesirable characteristics specific to a type are usually limited to those people whose &nbsp;type is heavily expressed, and then only if circumstances have combined to narrow or circumvent that person’s natural development. So in reading what follows, it is worth remembering that, in describing these typical tendencies and the negative patterns of behavior which can flow from them, we are building an understanding for positive development. Every person is differently made, and we must always remember that these so called “weaknesses” are the unavoidable, understandable and natural characteristics of our &nbsp;type.

&nbsp;

Most of the weaker characteristics found in ESTP’s result from Extraverted Sensing dominating their personality and co-opting the usefulness of their other functions, whilst some other difficulties stem directly from the ESTP’s inability to use their less adapted functions of Extraverted Feeling and Introverted &nbsp;Intuition. Either singly or in combination, these ESTP traits cause most or all of the following weaknesses &nbsp;&nbsp;in varying degrees:

  * Can become morose or even antagonistic in situations offering little promise of advantage or the possibility to “do ”
  * May be manipulative, taking advantage of other people’s weaknesses for their own
  * May be unwilling or unable to plan anything in advance themselves, or to follow other’s careful

&nbsp;

  * Can be overconfident of their own cunning or ability, ignoring problems which eventually catch up with them on their blind
  * May find it difficult or be actually unwilling to follow through where an ongoing commitment is
  * In relationship situations may be overbearing, demanding and/or uncaring of the feelings of their
  * When alone or in reduced circumstances may be subject to dark or morbid feelings about
  * May be unable to maintain employment for any length of time, losing credibility with potential employers or clients by job
  * May become so engrossed in challenging activities that they lose all sense of proportion, neglecting themselves and their
  * Without challenges of their own, may become focused on the behavior of others, particularly that of family or employees, insisting that they live up to what the ESTP sees as the proper code or level of

&nbsp;

<u>Explanation of Problems</u>

Because the ESTP is driven to experience the world through concrete sensation, their need for sensual experience combines with the possibilities of the moment to provide everything they feel is necessary to life. Using Introverted Thinking only to justify or enhance their sensual needs, the ESTP can easily flow with the world in a reckless manner, their own behavior mapped and justified by a ruling grid locked only to the objective action of the moment. Many of the difficulties described above flow from this common ESTP trait of attending only to the world and the people around them for the sake of satisfying their constant need for fresh experiences and new conquests. For the ESTP who lacks the support of a well adapted rational, judging function, the objective world remains an endlessly fascinating playground, where the constantly changing rules of the game often provide the only real codes of conduct they live by.

&nbsp;

Without a well developed Introverted Thinking function enabling the ESTP to reflect upon the consequences of their actions and desires, the feelings and needs of others can seem of little concern to them. Often, those who cannot match the ESTP round for round are considered persons of little consequence, or valued only as useful pawns in an endless game of one-upmanship where the gratification of the ESTP’s needs is the only object. In addition to this, because Feeling is the ESTP’s tertiary function, its judgments tend to be colored by the unconscious background, which means that it is often used negatively. In responding to the ESTP’s sense driven thinking assessments, such a feeling function plays down empathy and enhances the maintenance of negative feelings about others, particularly when they do not “go along” with the ESTP’s primary function driven ways and needs.

&nbsp;

Under such conditions the strongly expressing ESTP, whose auxiliary Introverted Thinking function serves only to make biased, supportive, “correct” judgments about their own behavior, will often “stand outside &nbsp;the circle”, their biased judgments reducing others to a mere audience, expected to support the ESTP’s notions without question. In relationships this can be a danger, for it means the ESTP will rarely accede to the feeling based demands of others, nor give credit to those ideas which arise from an intuitive outlook on life. Their behavior in this regard often borders on outright contempt or a sullen refusal to accept anything outside their own purview.

&nbsp;

Such strongly expressing ESTP’s can sometimes find themselves without any truly close relationships, for their behavior often provides a strong signal to others, who sense that “here be dragons”, and consequently offer as little as possible of their personal feelings or worldly knowledge as grist to the ESTP’s one- upmanship mill. Under these circumstances, whilst the ESTP may have lots of acquaintances and partners in fun, there will be very few who will befriend them at any truly supportive, emotional level.

&nbsp;

Apart from the reasons given above, some narrowly expressing ESTP’s can sometimes find themselves isolated because of the unusual things they believe about people and the world &#8211; particularly in regard to the reasons they believe certain things happen. The ESTP is extremely familiar with the workings of the immediate, rational world of the senses, but because their Intuition is a virtually unconscious function, their

&nbsp;

ideas about things outside their ken can quite often be extraordinarily quaint, superstitious or just downright bizarre, and their thinking can weave some amazing logic to support these beliefs. This rarely affects their day to day life, for these ideas and superstitions quite often support their keenness and abilities, but in a situation where truly intuitive or theoretical notions are considered relevant and important, the ESTP can &nbsp;find themselves very much the odd man out.

&nbsp;

Of all the personality types, the strongly expressing ESTP can be the hardest to convince that their world view is not the only valid one; that it does not necessarily spring from the best and only way to be; that everyone else in the world that is “normal” does not approach life in the same way as the ESTP.

&nbsp;

<u>Solutions</u>

To grow as an individual, the ESTP needs to focus on freeing their thinking from the control of Extraverted Sensing and allow them the space to make careful, rational judgments. Not only about the immediate, external situation, but also about the ways in which it can be managed to create a more valuable, long term result. The ESTP’s capacity to do this is innate; it hides just beneath the surface and takes only a few deliberate moments to allow it to work. All the ESTP needs to do is to recognize the difference between thinking with the moment, with the subject of their immediate sense impressions, and the thinking they do when nothing else grasps their attention. The ESTP needs to recognize that the second kind of thinking, this “alone with self” space, is full of potential for careful judgment of their actions and consideration of the &nbsp;&nbsp;best course for the future. Introverted Thinking is in truth the ESTP secret weapon. It is Introverted &nbsp;Thinking working in the background of their life which makes the ESTP such a potent personality.

Bringing it into the foreground, allowing its power to be no longer a secret to them is the key to ESTP development.

&nbsp;

I want to offer the ESTP some specific suggestions and advice here, for bringing the value of introspection into focus it isn’t just a matter of flipping a switch in the head. One of the reasons for this is that, when uncoupled from the fascinations of the outer world and reality, the ESTP’s Introverted Thinking tends to &nbsp;&nbsp;get caught up in the negative judgments and images which flow from their feeling and intuitive functions; &nbsp;all too easily falling into a cloudy, uncertain world of anxieties and sinister implications. The ESTP’s inner space needs to be cleared of this often childish and ill-informed miasma of negativity. So it is necessary to reassure yourself, to calmly and decisively insist upon quiet in your inner mind, and have faith that all concerns will be taken care of by the “adult of the household” (the mature version of Introverted Thinking.)

&nbsp;

Turning off the world and getting into your own space can be difficult at the beginning, but it provides the greatest rewards. For the ESTP doesn’t need to learn how to think, they already do it extremely well – they just need to turn their thinking upon themselves. They need to measure and evaluate their usefulness, their actions, their relationships in ways that look for quality, and in ways to offer value to all things and people in their lives.

&nbsp;

Challenge yourself. Challenges are simple stuff for the ESTP, and all it really takes is a few moments of reflection each day. Ask yourself regularly: “What am I doing? Why am I doing it? Who benefits from it?” Ask these questions in every type of situation, and discover how the answers begin showing a path toward not only greater understanding of self and others, but also show ways to include others in a relationship &nbsp;with your whole self. Soon you will discover your feelings and intuitions coming on board with a more positive and inclusive force. Growing yourself soon becomes easy, because it just takes the simple routine of letting your innate power of considered thought work upon your own life, rather than only using it to support what’s going on outside. Think about it. &nbsp;
