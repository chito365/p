  1. Feed Your Strengths! Realize your gift at mastering logical problems and situations, and give yourself plenty of opportunities to exercise your abilities. Much of your sense of well-being will come from these experiences.
  2. Face Your Weaknesses! We all have weaknesses. Recognizing your weaknesses for what they are (without beating yourself up) will give you the power to change your life for the better.
  3. Talk About Your Thoughts. Discussing your ideas and perceptions with others will help you to develop your Extraverted INtuition, and thus your understanding of the world. How well you use your auxiliary function is very important to your overall health and happiness.
  4. Listen to Everything Try not to dismiss anything immediately. Let it soak in, and then apply judgment. Try not to dismiss things that are illogical &#8211; they are not illogical.

  6. Recognize Social Principles. Realize that our society functions around some basic social principles, and that our society would fail unless those principles are recognized and upheld.

Your priorities and plans are important, but you must recognize that the external world&#8217;s agenda is also important. Don&#8217;t dismiss the importance of principles that don&#8217;t affect your life directly.
  7. Get Out of Your Comfort Zone Understand that the only way to grow is to get outside of your comfort zone. If you&#8217;re uncomfortable with an idea or situation because you&#8217;re not sure how to act, that&#8217;s good! That&#8217;s an opportunity for growth.
  8. Identify and Express Your Feelings You may have a hard time understanding how you feel about someone. It&#8217;s important that you do figure this out. Don&#8217;t lead

someone on with your ambivalence. If you determine that you value the person, tell them so every time you think of it. This is the best way to make them feel secure in your affections, and so to promote a long-lasting relationship.
