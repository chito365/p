Detailed Answers UNIT I 1. Explain refresh cathode ray tube? ♦ A beam of electrons, emitted by an electron gun, passes through focusing and deflection systems that direct the beam toward specified positions on the phosphor coated area. 16 ♦ The phosphor that emits a small spot of light at each position contacted by the electron beam ♦ One way to keep phosphor glowing is to redraw the picture repeatedly by quickly directing the electron beam back over the same points ♦ This type of display is called is called refresh CRT ♦ Primary components of electron gun are: 1. Heated metal cathode Heat is supplied to the cathode by directing the beam through a coil of wire called the filament inside the cylindrical cathode structure. 2. Control grid Intensity of the electron beam is controlled by setting the voltage levels on the control grid, which is a metal cylinder that fits to the cathode. ♦ Different kinds of phosphorus are available ♦ Besides color the major difference between phosphors is their persistence ♦ The maximum number of points that can be displayed without overlap on a CRT is referred to as resolution. ♦ Another property is aspect ratio 2. Explain color CRT monitors? A CRT monitor displays color pictures by using a combination of phosphors that emit different colored light. By combining the emitted light from the different phosphors, a range of colors can be generated Two techniques ♦ Beam penetration method ♦ Shadow mask method Beam penetration method ♦ Display color pictures ♦ Two layers of phosphors, usually red and green ♦ A beam of slow electrons excites the outer red layer ♦ Fast electron penetrates through the red layer and excites the inner green layer ♦ An intermediate beam speeds, combinations of red and green light Shadow mask method ♦ They produce a wider range of colors ♦ Has three phosphor color dots at each pixel position 17 ♦ One emits red light, another emits green light, and the third emits a blue light ♦ The three beams are deflected and focused as a group on to the shadow mask, which contains a series of holes aligned with a phosphor dot patterns. ♦ When the three beams passes through a hole in the shadow mask, they activate a dot triangle, which appears as a small color spot on the screen. 3. Explain direct view storage tubes and liquid crystal displays? Liquid crystal displays • Refers to the compounds having crystalline arrangement of molecules flow of liquid • Two plates each glass plate contains a light polarized that are right angles to each other • Two types Passive matrix LCD Active matrix LCD Direct view storage tubes • Alternative method for maintaining a screen image • Stores picture information as a charge distribution • Very complex pictures can be displayed at very high resolutions • To eliminate the picture section the entire screen must be erased • The erasing and redrawing process can take several seconds for a picture 4.Explain Raster scan systems? ♦ Several processing units ♦ Contains a special purpose processor, called video controller or display controller ♦ Video controller • A fixed area of the system memory is reserved for the frame buffer, and the video controller is given access to the framebuffer memory • Tow registers are used to store the coordinates of the screen pixels • The value is stored in the frame buffer for this pixel position is then retrieved and used to set the intensity of the CRT beam • Initially the x register is set to 0 and the y register is set to ymax • Then the x register is incremented by 1, and the process repeated for the next pixel on the top scan line • This process is repeated for each pixel along the scan line 18 • After the last pixels on the top scan line has been processed, the x register is reset to 0 and the yregister is decremented by 1. • The procedure is repeated fro each successive line ♦ Frame buffer locations and the corresponding screen positions are referenced as Cartesian coordinates I/O device 4. Explain the following? 1. Z-mouse 2. Joysticks 3. Touch panels 4. Image scanners 5. Data glove Z-Mouse: ♦ Include three buttons ♦ A thumb wheel on the side, a track ball on the top, and a standard mouse ball underneath. ♦ This design provides six degrees of freedom to select an object from the spatial position. ♦ Wit this we can pickup an object, rotate it and we can move it in any direction ♦ Used in virtual reality and CAD systems Joysticks • Consists of small vertical liver mounted on a base • Used to move the cursor around the screen • The screen cursor is moved according to the distance • One or two buttons is usually intended for signaling certain actions Touch panels • Three types • Optical touch panel System Bus CPU System Frame Memory Buffer Video controller 19 • Electrical touch panel • Acoustical touch panel • Allow selecting the screen position with the touch of finger. Touch input can be recorded using optical, electrical methods Image scanners ♦ Drawings, color and black and white photos or text can be given as an input to the computer with an optical scanning mechanism. ♦ According to reflected light intensity the gradations of gray scale or color can be stored in an array Data glove ♦ Constructed with a series of sensors that can detect hand and finger motions ♦ The transmitting and receiving antennas can be structured as a set of three mutually perpendicular cols, forming a three dimensional Cartesian coordinates system. ♦ Electromagnetic coupling between the three pairs of coil is used to provide information about the position and orientation of hand. UNIT II 1. Explain in detail about the DDA scan conversion algorithm? The digital differential analyzer is a scan conversion algorithm based on calculation either ∆y or ∆x using the following euations ∆y = m ∆x ∆x = ∆y / m Sample the line at unit intervals in one coordinate and determinecorresponding integer values nearest the line path for the coordinates Sample at X intervals (∆x = 1) and compute each successive Y value as Yk+1 = Yk + m 20 For lines with positive slope greater than 1, reverse the roles of X and Y. Sample at unit Y intervals (∆y = 1)and calculate each successive X value as Xk+1 = Xk + 1/m Algorithm Step 1: Input the line endpoints and store the left endpoint in (x1, y1) and right endpoint in (x2, y2) Step 2: Calculate the values of ∆x and ∆y using ∆x = xb – xa, ∆y = yb – ya Step 3: if the values of ∆x > ∆y assign values of steps as ∆x otherwise the values of steps as ∆y Step 4: Calculate the values of X increment and Y increment and assign the value x= xa and y = ya Step 5: for k=1 to steps do X = X + X increment Y= Y + Y increment Putpixel(ceil(x), ceil(y),15) Step 6: End 2. Explain Bresenhams line drawing algorithm? In Bresenham’s approach the pixel position along a line path are determined by sampling unit X intervals. Starting from the left end point(X0, Y0)of a given line we step to each successive columns and plot the pixel whose scan line Y-value is closest to the line path.Assuming the Kth step in process, determined that the pixel at (Xk, Yk)decide which pixel to plot in column Xk+1.The choices are (Xk+1, Yk) and (Xk+1, Yk+1) Algorithm Step 1: Input the line endpoints and store the left endpoint in (X0, Y0) Step 2: Load (X0, Y0) in to the frame buffer Step 3: Calculate constants ∆x, ∆y, 2 ∆y, -2 ∆x, and obtain the decision parameters as P0 = 2 ∆y – ∆x Step 4 : At each Xk along the line, starting at k = 0, perform the following test If Pk < 0, the next point to plot is (Xk+1, Yk) and Pk+1 = Pk+2 ∆y Otherwise, the next point to plot is (Xk+1, Yk+1) and Pk+1 = Pk+2 ∆y &#8211; 2 ∆x Step 5: Repeat step 4 ∆x times 3.

This is called boundary fill algorithm ♦ The boundary fill procedure accepts as input the coordinates of an interior point (x, y), a fill color, and a boundary color. ♦ Starting from (x, y), the procedure tests the neighboring positions to determine whether they are boundary color. ♦ If not, they are painted with the fill color, and the neighbors are tested. ♦ This process continues until all pixels up to the boundary color for the area have been tested ♦ Two methods ♦ 4- connected • 4 neighbouring points are conected ♦ 8-connected • correctly fill the interior of the area defined program void boundaryfill( int x, int y, int fill, int boundary) { int current; current = getpixel (x, y); if ((current != boundary) &&(current != nil) { setColor ( fill); setPixel ( x, y); boundaryfill (x+1, y, fill, boundary); boundaryfill (x-1, y, fill, boundary); boundaryfill (x, y+1, fill, boundary); boundaryfill (x, y-1, fill, boundary); }
