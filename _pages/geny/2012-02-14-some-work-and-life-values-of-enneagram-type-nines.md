## As a Nine, career satisfaction means doing work that&#8230;..

1. Allows me to work with other creative, considerate, accepting people in a cooperative, stressfree  
environment with no interpersonal conflict, tension or strife.  
2. Allows me to work with a boss (if not self-employed) who is supportive, patient,  
understanding, easy to get along with, and shows sincere appreciation for my work.  
3. Makes use of my natural ability to communicate with and relate to anyone with relative ease.  
4. Provides some structure and organization to my day so that I don’t end up getting distracted,  
daydreaming too much, or wasting my time being unproductive.  
5. Creates more peace, harmony and unity in the world.  
6. Makes use of my nonjudgmental listening skills and ability to understand other people from  
their point of view.  
7. Supports and benefits other people but gives me a clear sense of what will be expected of me  
(so that I don’t end up getting sucked into doing more than I really want to do).  
8. Allows me time to do good work at my own pace without compelling me to make  
instantaneous decisions or work under pressure to tight deadlines.  
9. Makes use of my ability to mediate conflicts, put people at ease and gain others’ trust.  
10. Allows me to use my powerful imagination and natural ability to think holistically.  
11. Makes use of my innate ability to see the positive in a situation, in people and in life.
