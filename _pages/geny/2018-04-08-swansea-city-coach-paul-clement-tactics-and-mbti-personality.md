Paul Clement was the head coach of Swansea City in 2017.

Born in Reading, Clement started coaching from the age of 23, working with Chelsea.

He became a full-time coach in 2000 following his appointment with Fulham's academy, while he coached in the Republic of Ireland under-21 national team.

A return to Chelsea in 2007 led to the Englishman becoming assistant manager under Carlo Ancelotti in 2009.

Together they won the Premier League title, before joining up again at Paris Saint-Germain, following Clement's brief coaching spell at Blackburn Rovers.

Ancelotti and Clement won the Ligue 1 trophy with PSG and the pair then added the Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League to their CV with Real Madrid in 2014.

Derby County appointed Clement as their manager in the summer of 2015 but he departed the club later in the 2016/16 season.

Bayern Munich was Clement's next coaching role, working alongside Ancelotti at a fourth club.

On 3 January 2017, Swansea announced Clement as Bob Bradley's replacement at the Liberty Stadium.

In his first month in charge, Clement received the Barclays Manager of the Month award after three victories in four matches.

He guided the Swans to 15th after battling relegation for the rest of the campaign, however the two parted company in December 2017.

    <h4>
      Tactical Philosophy
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      <span lang="EN-US">Learning under a manager as successful as Carlo Ancelotti and working in several different leagues has helped shape Paul Clement’s footballing philosophy.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <span lang="EN-US">However, in all the clubs where he’s assisted Ancelotti, he has had players of the highest caliber to work with, the likes of Didier Drogba (Chelsea), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (PSG), Sergio Ramos and Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid), headline the top level players he has worked with, but this could serve as a disadvantage as the quality of players at Swansea city is markedly inferior. Clement however, is incredibly pragmatic and prices defensive solidity above other things.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Formation and Tactical Structure</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In football, there are basically two categories of coaches: &nbsp;Category A: Those that prioritize control (Guardiola, Mourinho, Joachim Low, Maurizio Sarri), and Category B: Those that prioritize dynamism and seek to create transition moments as much as possible (Ralph Hassenhuttle, Jurgen Klopp) NOTE: This is not a hard and fast categorization as there is a degree of malleability in coaching approaches. In the former category, we have a sub category of those that seek to achieve control through possession of the ball (coaches like Pep Guardiola) and those that seek to achieve control primarily through defensive control of the space (Diego Simeone, Jose Mourinho). Paul Clement would fall into the latter category with his first thought being controlling the opponent’s play by controlling the space. To do this, he usually employs a 4 -1 – 4 -1/4 – 4 – 2 zonal defensive formation to achieve horizontal and vertical compactness.

Any thoughts about other ones? I've got my thoughts, but I'm not really sure of them, so I think I'll wait for other theories about further managers (and players).
