Of the two, Nines are more likely to want contact because they like the feeling of merging with a partner. Nines tend to idealize their partner and could have a tendency to take on the Five’s life and feelings as their own were it not for the fact that Fives don’t like emotional dependency. Fives don’t want to be Nine’s sole object of focus. Fives can also get impatient with Nine’s indecisiveness and indirectness.

  * If Five and Nine live together and either feels that the other has emotionally detached him/herself they might develop an unspoken (or spoken) agreement to keep the peace in the home and just do their own They can peacefully co-exist while having no real relationship.

Learn to take the initiative rather than waiting for Nine to initiate.

&nbsp;

## For Nines

  * Be more independent and take more Learn to set your own agenda and priorities rather than looking to your Five partner to set the agenda. This will help you develop self-confidence and less likely to fall into mind-numbing routines.
