### <span id="Other_work" class="mw-headline">Other work</span>

Smith raised controversy in 2016 after modelling in a womenswear campaign for Louis Vuitton wearing a skirt.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference">[62]</sup> Explaining his choice to wear a skirt, Smith said he was attempting to combat bullying, saying &#8220;In five years, when a kid goes to school wearing a skirt, he won&#8217;t get beat up and kids won&#8217;t get mad at him.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference">[63]</sup> Smith continued to wear womenswear throughout the rest of 2016.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference">[64]</sup> Smith was the first male model to model women&#8217;s wear for Louis Vuitton.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference">[65]</sup> Smith created a denim-line with fashion brand G-Star in 2018.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference">[66]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference">[67]</sup>

## <span id="Personal_life" class="mw-headline">Personal life</span>

Smith&#8217;s father, Will, revealed that his son sought an emancipation ruling, with the consent of his parents, as a 15th birthday present. Will revealed to the media that Smith&#8217;s primary motivation is the establishment of his own residence and also explained that his children are not subject to strict parenting conduct: &#8220;We generally don&#8217;t believe in punishment. From the time Jaden was five or six we would sit him down, and all he has to do is be able to explain why what he did was the right thing for his life.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference">[73]</sup> However, Smith and his father appeared together on _The Ellen DeGeneres Show_ on May 15, 2013, and Smith said:

> The thing that people don&#8217;t get is everything at his house is free. So I can get anything and everything at his house, so I&#8217;m going to be there for 20, 30 more years. He [Will Smith] says that as soon as I have a movie that&#8217;s bigger than one of his movies I can get my own house.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference">[74]</sup>

In June 2017, Smith moved out of his parents&#8217; house into a $4 million home in Hidden Hills.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference">[75]</sup>

Smith is a vivid &#8220;conspiracy theorist&#8221; and his statements often generate controversy.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference">[76]</sup> This includes theories about the Illuminati<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference">[77]</sup><sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference">[78]</sup>, tweets about Chemtrails<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference">[79]</sup> and believing extraterrestrial life exists.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference">[80]</sup>

In 2013, Smith raised controversy when he criticized traditional education and advised people to drop out of school.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_10-1" class="reference">[10]</sup> Talking about teenagers who go to public school, Smith said &#8220;kids who go to normal school are so teenagery, so angsty.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference">[81]</sup>

Smith dated Sarah Snyder from 2015 to 2017. The two broke up after &#8220;growing apart&#8221; amid cheating rumors.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference">[82]</sup> Snyder inspired numerous songs on Smith&#8217;s debut album, _Syre._<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference">[</sup></dt> </dl>
